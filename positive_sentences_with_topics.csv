welcome to warframe,26
the best part of this game is figuring out what you want to to next because theres so much to do however the worst part of this game is figuring out what you want to to next because theres so much to do,-1
how good is warframe story,19
extremely good on every update everyone wait for the story and some returnee player came back just to continue the story thats how good the story in warframe is,-1
why are people saying just play warframe well because it is a good game unlike any other looter shooter warframe basically popularize this genre and have been doing the right thing for almost  yeas and still staying strong and bringing new thing to this genre,-1
ive played this game before it got release on steam ive seen ups and down changes and reversion so if you want a game that appreciate your time warframe is your game doesnt matter even if you left for years and return theres always community that are willing to help you relearn if youre disappointed by division destiny the first descendant give warframe a try theres nothing to lose but your time warframe is so far the only game that hear what the players want and manage to kept their investor happy doing so they wont force you to buy dlc to play new story or to progress this is very rare thing in these day of age where most dev lock things behind a pay wall so have a go,-1
once cross save is available i will start playing this game again,-1
until then ill just say i had a great time playing it on console,7
i finally finished the tutorial,51
after k hours in this game i can say its okay,7
seeing as tennocon just happened a few days ago and has been gathering a lot interests since then i think it would be a good idea to finally make a review on this thing,40
i mean i have like what  hours on this game so i think i qualified to talk about this game,7
each warframe comes with a set of abilities to make them all special and their mobility allows them to get across the stages with ease and will become second nature before you know it,14
this means that it doesnt take long for new players to reach the highest level with their gear with encouraging them to try new things as they play the game,-1
this is one of warframes strongest points,26
this makes the game extremely replayable as you can experiment with different builds for your gear,14
lucky warframe is one of the very best when it comes to this almost all items can be bought from the games shop but they cost alot compared to how easy some of them are,27
even tho i just said the game is extremely replayable this is still a loot shooter meaning there will be grinding at times,14
but hey ive over  hours on the game and im still able to enjoy the game most of the time,7
if you like what you hear then give it a try its free after all,30
free to play done right,0
free to play done correctly,0
graphics i had to start off by reviewing the graphical quality of this game because its so beautiful,1
everything is well polished and goodlooking the appearance of warframe will not hesitate to immerse you into the environment,-1
on top of that graphically the game is extremely well optimized compared to other games and can run on many older computers without an issue,1
clearly a lot of love has been put into this game and you can tell that immediately just by looking at how beautiful and immersive the game is,63
warframes content and gameplay are some of the best for any freetoplay game out there,79
everything in warframe is available without paying if you are willing to grind for it,27
one of the best freemium models out there seriously,0
you can earn platinum the premium currency ingame without ever spending a cent on it,48
,2
that is a fantastic amount of customization and one of the things i love most about the game,39
warframe has a ton of cosmetics and theyre all extremely beautiful and wonderful,-1
in fact some of the best cosmetics in the game can only be purchased with real money the tennogen cosmetics are handsomely crafted with love by individual creators and your money goes back to those creators supporting them and allowing them to make more wonderful content for the game,8
still if you invest your time into the grind you can acquire nearly anything you want for no cost at all,-1
one great thing about warframe is that they are constantly updating the game and delivering new content to us,55
while its not always the best and most optimized content i see more love poured into warframe content than that of any other game at the current time,-1
the devs maintain a strong relationship with the community and actively ask questions to the players about what they want to see and what they want changed and do frequent livestreams for fun and for discussing where they are in terms of development with the game,11
their strong community commitment is one of the great things that many people love about warframe des transparency and willingness to maintain a strong bond with us is something that not many other game companies can brag about,66
so if you read my entire thing and some of my points sparked your interest i would definitely reccommend giving the game a go,13
i have loved every second ive played of warframe and i can honestly say its one of the only games whose future updates im currently excited for,-1
it takes time to grind for resources and build things but if you can develop patience that grinding pays off and the game will only get deeper and more complex as a result,3
i am unfortunately at the point where i cant quite get into it anymore which is sad but the memories i have from warframe are super happy to say the least,32
making the choice to try warframe is one of the best decisions ive ever made,-1
i made lifelong friends while playing this game,15
thanks to de for everything theyve done i always felt supported as a player here,-1
absolutely legendary game so much fun to be had,-1
if you somehow have not tried this game yet please give it a go,13
cheers,6
the movement in warframe is absolutely glorious,26
did i mention the graphics because this game looks gorgeous,1
the warframes the weapons near infinite variety and so much fun,14
playing with friends is the best,15
but its also a lot of fun,52
highly recommended,25
overall the devs are extremely generous and for the most part listen to the community also red text,11
when you play this game itll be good,-1
been doing that for some time now not bad,7
would recommend fantastic for a free game,0
i recommend warframe solely because it is a good game,19
daunting yes warframe is huge  as it well should be after almost six continuous years of postrelease development but that quantity upholds a consistent level of quality rivalling any other well received well reviewed title,-1
you can reach a decent point in the game after some investment but it will take thousands of hours to truly complete everything it has to offer,-1
warframe is truly unique an experience ive never encountered anywhere else and truthfully not tailored to everyones particular tastes,26
are they all great,-1
questing has been improving greatly over the years and the content in the last couple has provided amazing lore and gameplay mechanics with some exceptional writing  and they seem only to be improving,67
in a couple weeks youll have a few frames and a bunch of weapons in a couple of months youll have accrued quite the varied arsenal and within a year youll likely have almost everything if not all of it,-1
the combat of warframe is simple and yet incredibly complex,-1
the latest of which the massive open world of fortuna has turned out to be and incredible display of amazing and well detailed level design,38
warframe bears perhaps the most forgiving free to play scheme ever  and that is because you can obtain everything without ever paying a penny,27
platinum the premium currency can be obtained by simply trading ingame items to players  one can accrue thousands upon thousands without ever putting money into this and that is what is recommended,48
bottom line  warframe is a great game free or not,27
you should give it a go  and make friends its the best way to play,-1
the best  hours ive ever spent,7
would highly reccomend it,25
de has done a fantastic job at taking a mediocre game and transforming it into a content giant with a great community and a satisfying game loop of farming resources and building weapons and new frames,68
i have met many good friends and made lots of memories in warframe,32
and its free,30
thank you de for what you have done,-1
i think everyone should at least try this amazing game and experience its dedicated development team and community managers,-1
i give warframe a near perfect as far as games go,19
believe me though  its worth it,20
i really do love this game,28
even if i go on hiatus for months or even longer i can always come back to it and there will be something for me to do,-1
i enjoy the gameplay loop im invested in so many of the characters and the amount of customization available for your warframe is just fantastic,-1
this game is entirely freetoplay but its one i gladly put money into,49
i love it,16
grind the new update step,12
as a girl who grew up playing with dolls and dressup games this game is a perfect middle ground for me and my cousin to both enjoy,15
as someone who really believes in showing gratitude i have spent a lot of money to give back to the developers,-1
this game is a wonderful work of art,1
hours in pretty good game so far,7
first week its ok second week cool game third week wow great game fourth week  hours,-1
also has tons of playable characters warframes that have special magic powers like going invisible or throwing stars which you can already equip normally,14
i like zephyr,-1
tons of collectible guns and such with notsomuch space to store them but its a pretty nice shooty shooty bang bang game for people who enjoy things like destiny  borderlands uniques or the mindless grind of minecraft,-1
but theres similar things in other reviews and you can prob just google the game itself to learn more about the amazing timesink that is warframe,-1
its probably my favorite thing that warframe does that other games dont,-1
though if i had spent money i could probably have hit mr at around k hours rather than k but i enjoy the grind so its really up to you,3
every time i come back the game is significantly better than it used to be which is surprising because its always been good,-1
i seriously recommend it as long as you dont mind grinding,3
everything except skins are available for free as long as you dont mind working for what you want and even the in game currency is obtainable through player to player trading,8
i cant praise digital extremes enough for demonstrating good game development,42
hail to space mom,5
and yet i continue for the grind never stops,3
to cut to the chase its a good game,77
if you can figure out the core mechanics especially modding your weapons and frames youll be fine protip the community is not bad ask for help but not handouts if you need it,14
also the warframe wiki is your best friend for finding stuff and figuring stuff out,-1
good because there is always something to do,-1
my favorite thing about warframe is that it allows you to hop on do a thing or two with or with out friends and hop off,-1
yes you can buy almost anything if you shell out he cash but what often goes unnoticed is that you can get all frames and weapons by playing the game no real money required,8
is this the best model,1
no it is not but is is a lot better than other systems,1
also there are no loot boxes which is nice,-1
so its a good game with incredible customization gameplay and fashion wonderful quests not spoiling those here they are great trust me fair monetization and a pretty good community,-1
its definitely a slow burn but it is a great game like no other,-1
a must read review,40
soooo i wanna take the time to thank the last descendant for bringing me here,43
this is a much better game,-1
highly recommend giving it a few hours,20
gud gamestill gudye still a gud gamegud game still,71
good game play it for a little bit    over  years,-1
this is what a modern free to play game should admire to be,0
want a game where a community will welcome you with open arms,4
want a game that has a storyline that will kick you in the nuts so hard and still make you say that felt good,18
well warframe is all that and i guarantee that if you are a scifi lover and an mmo rpg lover then this game is the absolute best of both worlds,19
theres a reason why this game has so much respect in the gaming community,4
definitely give it a shot,20
an excellent example of fp game done right,10
pros  nice graphics  dynamic and engaging gameplay  unique visual style and story  good coop pve experience  nonintrusive and balanced monetization  excellent devs communication and feedback  game is constantly developing and new features become available regularly  cons  the gameplay becomes grindy over time  pvp is almost nonexistent  so i higly recommend this game if you are into coop pve thirdperson shooters,47
its a kind of game when if you get tired of it  you can always take a break return at some later point and see a lot of new and interesting stuff added with the latest updates,-1
the community is getting better,4
defintly recommend it to everybody amazing game and community,13
none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good,57
recommended,25
does not change the fact the game still has all the same amazing content it always had and more,57
love grind,3
big boom,6
crosssave worked back in action,-1
gameplay is solid and fun the lore can be hard to understand but is still interesting and the microtransactions not only feel more justified because you know freetoplay game but it doesnt get in the way of gameplay,-1
probably the only game where i spent money on the microtransactions and didnt regret it,-1
this game is just a better destiny,41
best community i have ever seen in a game,4
yes yes i would recommend it,25
reading is good thank you warframe xd,19
very good game at the start it can be overwhelming and seem boring but once you get into it the game is incredibly fun,-1
devs are great and very interactive with the fandom,11
its definitely support,-1
definitely,33
the game itself is a extremely solid third person shooter,22
satisfying,34
community is absolutely ace too,4
blown away by how much content is in a free game,0
ps the developers have a rather good pedigree too,11
yes yes yes,33
after playing destiny for a long time and finally deciding to actually try warframe i can safely say that this game is infinitely better than destiny,-1
the combat feels rewarding the customization feels rewarding the modding feels rewarding,-1
compared to destiny warframe makes you feel powerful,-1
nothing is paid for you can grind for everything you need and that is the best thing a free to play game can offer,3
have fun,61
trust me first impressions can be misleading but this is honestly one of the most fair fp games in the market,10
i started playing warframe from first release and im still playing,32
now almost  months later im a better reformed person getting on with life but still manage to enjoy a game of warframe with the friends,32
warframe was one of my favourite games the play to win and not pay to win system made it so much better for everyone,19
i will still give a thumbs up for the old content its a game worth trying even though its a bit hard in the beginning before you figure out how it works,-1
was fun was free and that was it all,0
i realized story fragments enjoyed the narratives and understood some of the content and features,18
i took what i needed,4
progress was satisfying,34
i saw that i delevoped and became a better tenno,44
i saw that warframe changed and became a better game,-1
the urge to serve a greater good is strong in me now,-1
i know the challenges and more will be there to come,-1
i know the way to perfection and more obstacles will be there to overcome,-1
a universe full of diverse content and a storytelling which brought tears into my eyes,18
you above all people know how much fun there is to be had here,-1
its a fun game,46
this game is actually the peak of free to play games,0
you can really tell the devs actually care about the players instead of creating a quick buck,11
this is the prime example of how to make a free to play game fun and fair other devs should take notes,0
games addicting,21
it is possible to get everything you want in the game without spending any money,8
we are just gamers who want to play and support the games we love,-1
ive played a little bit its ok,7
the best freeplay game even better than most of the paid ver games,0
good       edit ok,6
more content than destiny  and its free,70
and i have loved every moment of it,16
welcome to warframe,26
i have absolutely no idea whats happening but it sure is fun,52
i tried it seems good,20
after  hours i can confidently say   its ok i guess,7
were all here to help,4
now may rngesus bless us all with our riven rolls so that we can sell them for  platinum,48
because of this game i found a girlfriend and a best friend,15
i am what i am because of this game  otherwise i wouldve achieved a lot more in life,-1
i asked my son for help and he helped me,4
i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died,16
this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well,-1
this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories over the years,63
thank you,6
its aight  still getting good updates tons of content easy to make premium currency without spending a dime,8
today was a good day,6
warframe is by far my favorite game and most likely will be for all time,19
its a beautiful game that runs on nearly all systems,1
the game is a third person shooter focused on pve with character abilities quality gunplay and unlike most shooters melee is a perfectly viable alternative,22
high power characters moving at a quick fun pace,9
now on to the free to play aspect if any game deserves that title warframe is that game,27
warframe has the cleanest free to play game i have ever played,27
no fret though the cosmetics made by the warframe team are great if you have no money for player made cosmetics,-1
i love this game and i love the people in it this is probably the most friendly community in any game,4
i want new players to join this game and im willing to help teach anyone who needs a little help,4
anything to get more people into this lovely game,53
warframe is massive gripping in profound ways and for several reasons among the best games ever made in my opinion,19
pros  the movement is really satisfying in pretty much every part of the game,9
moving around with your warframe makes you feel strong limber wellhoned,26
there are vehicles and other characters that you get to move around as well and the movement of those feel wellsuited too,9
as long as you engage with the game you get to feel like a god,-1
the gunplay and melee is wellcrafted with a wide array of choices to go for,-1
modding your gear to work with you and not against you in combat is fundamental and a lot of fun,31
this is just a few things that i think are fantastic with the combat but ill cut it off here as not to make this centered totally around this one point,9
crucially the things you are doing to get the drops are still fun,-1
the lore is pretty indepth even if it isnt all splayed out in the quests or in missions,18
its touching and has some serious complexity to it in places,69
its really truly nice,6
this is positive because the player being forced to go through this specific part of the lore also gives important exposition and gear for content that follows,18
not to mention warframe seems to attract mostly really wonderful and caring people,-1
its a very welcoming place in comparison to many other places online,4
if anything it gives you a reason to play more when a new island drops,-1
across the board warframe is a stimulating colorful timeconsuming emotional experience,-1
i havent even scraped the surface here and after many years i still feel excitement playing the game,-1
i recommend this game,13
love to see it,16
number go bigger make brain make happy juice,-1
the best free to play game out there with consistent content updates just try it,0
over  hours of game time and it was fun,7
lots o fun,61
what a blast,69
much better,-1
im very happy with what has become of wf and highly recommend if you are looking for an online shooter that may be played coop or solo,-1
either way wf is a great game,19
theres a lot to love in warframe and a lot of stuff to do,26
its super pretty looking and it feels great to experience,69
my favorite thing about other similar games like destiny  is the connection between pvp and pve,78
you bring your gear into pvp and that makes you feel triumph when you win,78
i recently finished a build i really liked,-1
after years of casual play i finally had maxed out this build,-1
i was so happy and then i thought so what do i do with it,-1
but thats how i feel and id still recommend playing the game,13
been here  years and ill be here for years to come,43
warframe is one of those games that you quit for a while because of what ever reason you might have but then come back to it eventually and you get immersed into it again especially with the most recent addition to the game plains of eidolon,32
pros  free to play  amazing visuals  great optimisation  can choose if the player wants to play solo or multiplayer  a lot of different game modes for the player to enjoy  a lot of different warframes and weapons to enjoy  fixed archwing  dojos  variety of different missions to enjoy  freeplay without being paywin  cons  at some point the game gets repetitive mostly only when farming for something  sometimes the game feels like youre just mashing one button mostly vs infested  long update times due to the launcher at least for some people  game overall is great and most definitely worth checking out especially since its of high quality and free to play,47
its free try it,30
great story great amount of things to do great community nice staff common events almost nothing within the game that cant be farmed for even most of the cosmetics can be gotten through either selling in game items for the pay currency or from trading in standing with the various groups,8
a prime ehhehe example of free to play done right,0
if you like action oriented games loot driven games third person shooters going real fast the art style or any combination of those things youll probably like warframe,-1
played for more than  hours total and i still dont know what the hell am i doin but boomboom and pow pow issa good game with very hardworking devs kudos,7
this games pretty cool if you hate yourself,28
this game has one of the most wholesome communities on the internet,4
not only are people supportive of whatever goal you may have when you play the game and willing to help you even if they get nothing out of it themselvesbut i have been gifted boosts and crafting material by very kind higher level players after hanging out with them for a few missions,4
while this game is quite grindy its very easy to chit chat with people while you play or zone out to your favorite music,-1
check pretty graphics and can play on potato pc,1
check  what more can you ask for a game that is free and gives you everything you want to enjoy about a ninjaisk game,5
warframe is one of the most unique games that i have played,19
most of the warframes in the game have a prime variant that has better stats than their original counterparts,-1
mods are the backbone for weapons and warframes in this game so they are a key part of buildcrafting,14
the amount of content available to play in warframe is astonishing for a free to play game,27
there are other benefits but these are the main reasons to increase your mastery rank,-1
once completing the entire star chart there is new content to explore afterwards,38
the benefit of completing steel path aside from mastery rank is that mod and resource drops are greatly increased so you can earn more rewards for completing missions in steel path,-1
this activity features a rotation of activities that give you a lot of unique rewards and endo which is used to upgrade mods,-1
i dont want to fully explain everything in this game but there is so much to do in this game and i dont feel bored when playing because you can always do something different,-1
definitely give warframe a try,-1
we all lift together,34
as a destiny  player i am starting to open my eyes to this game a lot more,84
and as a returning player since the plains of eidolon i love how welcoming back the community is and is happy to help with whatever you need to catch up,4
i also received many welcome back gifts which were such a welcome surprise for how much i was getting from people for warframe slots weapon slots companion slots etc,-1
i dont write reviews often but as a chronic destiny lover and player this is the best community and a refreshing one even rivaling final fantasy s community,40
i cannot wait to jump into more,62
to the one person reading this youre pretty rad,6
have a nice day,6
accidentally played for  hours straight so it must be good p,7
you delay and do cool spins,9
grind heaps,3
tonkor is awesome,-1
success,34
oh wow for once i actually need rubedo now,3
product received for free  i am a  year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game,17
my son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing,-1
me and my son then played in turns and i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died,16
this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well,-1
this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,63
for those of you who played before  take note  since the second dreams release warframe has been extensively given a lot of love and care and is beyond a mere games worth of content,19
prime warframes and weapons can be earned through void relics and easily traded for platinum the games premium currency in an economy that easily makes it possible for completely freetoplay players to enjoy the games cosmetics and easily gather the resources they need with a little effort,-1
everything takes a short amount of time to farm and a long time to cook  but if you pace yourself well you can accomplish a lot within a week of playing this game once youre past the early hours,35
this game doesnt hold your hand however  expect to get confused with the modding and forma system at first but its a satisfying learning experience reminiscent of s gaming where you actually put some bloody effort into your games,13
combat is fluid freeform  the parkour system is genuinely fun to use and fits well with the fastpaced combat of the game,9
digital extremes who have history in aaagaming before this  the darkness  was a great game if not short are consistently providing their love and support into the game alongside informing the community of their future plans for the game,42
hands down i would recommend this game  i mean my friends got k hours on it so clearly she must find a reason to keep playing it since launch,-1
thats the highest hour count for any game ive played in my library,7
better then destiny,41
games so good and fun specially with friends oh also r artists are good,15
it all depends on the type of gamer that you are for me this game is like crack its too addicting and i love it,21
coming from someone who owns well over a couple hundred games ps and pc i always come back to warframe,32
its that good,29
warframe is a great game with a few issues surrounding it,19
the pros in my opinion are you never feel pressured to buy platinum since trading is easy and so is getting credits,48
each frame character that ive owned have all felt unique and pleasurable to play,14
the game looks gorgeous hands down,1
its use of lighting and such make it look fantastic,1
the missions while repetitive at times are enjoyable,37
there is a great variety of frames weapons and mods to challenge yourself to learn,14
coop is easy and lagfree as far as what ive experienced,24
in summary pick this game up if you have a few friends with it and become a ninja today,5
none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good,57
game good,45
excellent story innovative gameplay eyecatching graphics thick warframe ass what more could i ask for,-1
one of the best fp games out there,10
product received for free  this game is better than destiny,70
ok i told myself if i reach  hours in this game ill write a review  and im not here to tell you about the game there are other reviews that do that better than me but i will tell why i like it,-1
fourth the devs kind of listen fifth the grind is not exhausting  you can get your stuff rather quick  so yea,3
pretty good,6
thumbs up for warframe,26
as a fp game it is a bit grindy but the aesthetic as well as the feel of downing enemies and the sheer fun of ripping apart hordes keeps me coming back,10
is even better with friends,15
,2
this game is polished,-1
i mean like you can see your reflection its so polished,1
,2
fortuna is now my nd alltime favorite town in a videogame only behind tristramfor me,38
such unique and creative content,-1
im hooked and i highly doubt ill be buying any other looter shooter after destiny  which i quit after a week and im glad i didnt bother to buy anthem,84
warframe is complete and is so much more deserving of my money and support,-1
thank you digital extremes you guys and gals are a cut above the rest,42
its like a real life girlfriend,-1
only far less expensive and easier to grind,3
that being said it is without a doubt one of the best games out there,54
the games within the game are amazing,23
this is the hidden gem,-1
the love the devs and the community has for this game is outstanding,11
new players are welcomed with open arms,4
give warframe a good soild try,-1
its amazing,6
it framed my war real good,26
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
one of the best free to play models i encountered   no content locked behind paywalls except decorative stuff with no gameplay impact,8
also i wish i could travel back to  before i started playing warframe and tell myself that one day i would be more excited about a major content update of a fp game than the next fallout game just to see my reaction,-1
warframe has some of the best art direction and i daresay my favourite artstyle of any scifi universe theres heavy elements of biotech and each enemy faction in the game has a distinct aesthetic that ties into their background and the way they fight,-1
regarding monetization like many other reviews have said warframes monetization is fair and plenty of players play through the game with no disadvantages without spending a cent,8
a review about warframe is not complete without mentioning its origins and success warframe is a freetoplay indie game but it has achieved great success in spite of this because you will be hard pressed to find a team of developers that communicates better than warframes their community team has streams from monday to thursday consistently and fridays have a biweekly devstream where the community coordinator the creative director the design director and the art director just sit on a couch and talk to the players about their plans about whats next for the game and they also answer players questions,-1
pretty good for a few hours of gameplay,7
better then destiny,41
finally crosssave i can keep playing with garuda and wisp,-1
itll never stop,-1
grab a friend and prepare for some of the most badass space ninja gameplay youve ever experienced,5
its alright i guess,72
im not too far into the game but its okay so far,7
edit lol the new expansion takes place on the day i was born so ayyyyyyyyyyy,-1
original review better than destiny  so theres that,41
product received for free  i liked the fishing,17
by far one of the best games i have played  the first hours can be frustating considering that there are no ingame tutorial to explain all of the mchanics but thats the region chat is for,-1
he gloats and tries to claim you as a prize for his evil queens of the grineer but you break free with the help of the mysterious lotus a beautiful woman seeking more tenno like yourself,-1
now in a cosmic frontier of space ninjas evil cloned descendants of humanity and a scavenging corporation of another branch of evil mankind your path is clear  become the best space ninja with an insane selection of armor weapons and so much customization options that you dont know where to begin,5
you take the fight to the space zombies the  and learn how to craft better weapons and warframes along the way painting all you use and own in dull colors of green and blue trying your best to honor the memory of your erstwhile love,5
she offers peace security and longevity happiness as an eternity with her doing her bidding so that the galaxy remains safe,5
in another time you would gladly have been one of hers,-1
product received for free  its pretty fun i only have a few hours but from what i have played its neat,17
days  hrs mastery   conclusion is nice,-1
a better and free version of anthem,70
if you plan to go past just a few hours whatever sanity remained it will slowly be disintegrated as you continue to play but at least youll be having a load of fun by then   i like to generalize the warframe experience in  phases the new player the general player the masochi i mean the true space ninja  the new player most who just started the game would feel very overwhelmed after completing the first few intial missions as there is literially no more given help or tips on what to do next,-1
the true space ninja as repetitive any gamemode may be in warframe the amount of frames and weapons to choose from make the grind not just bearable but legitimately fun,5
the joy of bringing the wrong set up to a mission then finding out by the end it worked better than expected,37
solid gameplay fair fp and an absolutely ponderous amount of content  the community is also super chill and helpful aside from the handful of people fuming over the nerf of obnoxious weapons at the moment,4
better than destiny,41
this game is historically correct,64
ive clearly played this for a ridiculous number of hours and really like this game but i will try to be objective,-1
but if you can understand its a series of small bitesized dopamine rewards its so fun,-1
the story is an amazing complicated maze of political intrigue and alternate realities,18
if you enjoy power fantasy and space ninjas stick with it,5
ive started playing warframe  year ago it was free and looked a nice game,27

no one said it would be easy but given time you can do it,-1
the graphics are fantastic and the controls are very dynamic,1
i also love how i can put the game down for a little while and pick it back up no problem,-1
all of this in a free to play game that offers a great deal of fun,0
its not a perfect game but its made by people who clearly enjoy making it and it shows,-1
full of heart and bold ideas never afraid to get weird,62
the music is out of this world the story dares to try something different in this tired world of live service games and the gameplay is a mix of cool things the devs wanted to see in their game and that alone makes it worth playing,1
alright i havent played for very long but this is already better than destiny,84

other than that if you work hard and spend a decent amount of time on it everything important is attainable without paying money for it,8
i do encourage you to support the developers by buying things that you may like but only at your own discretion,-1

if you are looking for a game where you can casually spend time with friends be astounded by the copypasta maps that always hold great beauty laugh at the funny bugs that can be found on rare occassions fight for the honor of the merciless tenno or find a challenge mastering the games distinct mechanics and unmatched thirdperson combat then i welcome you to join warframe,-1

,2
but if you have friends the experience can be quite funny actually,15
its pretty good,29
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
memes aside the game is wonderful and i would pay full price for it but its free,0
i didnt think id like warframe i was very wrong and now its one of my favourite games it looks complicated to play but once you get into it its much easier than it looks i can easily go do some of the hardest content and turn my brain off to function on muscle memory alone the community is also great usually the hardcore content is full of tryhards and people who take games too seriously here i had a culture shock the hardest content has some of the most chill and helpful people ive ever met in a mmo,-1
i highly recommend trying it i personally struggle with duviri because the colour shifting gives me a headache but otherwise its a very fun game regular updates theres flavor text that is hilarious if theres a hotfix theres plenty of twitch drops for cosmetics etc and events regularly give very good rewards,-1
digital extremes has made an enjoyable engrossing spectacular game,42
especially when you find yourself a team or  even better  invite some friends,15
as far as free games go this is the best on the market,0
very addictive once you are hooked,21
my favorite farming simulator,35
warframe is an impressive work of a game,26
you can obtain everything noncosmetic in the game without paying a dime,8
after youve ranked up you now have access to better weaponry to take on bigger things,31
the mission variety is good the amount of weapons can be overwhelming but theres always something to do,31
de is an excellent company they do livestreams every other fridaycould be mistaken on schedule and talk about whats going on what theyre working on and what they want to do,-1
give the game a try its pretty fun,13
pretty rewarding later on,-1
nice graphics smooth animations combined with a huge variety of content decent lore and a plethora of weapons and abilities as well as a big amount of customization both with said weapons and abilities as well as the looks of your gear let this game stand out among its rather bland first and third person shooter peers,-1
the community is overall very approachable and friendly while you will find nice people and morons everywhere in every game as it is a coop focused game rather than pvp the majority of players are rather easy going,4
the game itself is rather casual friendly,-1
the game is one of the best in its genre when it comes to a free to play approach offering pretty much all content in some way or form without the need to pay for it,0
unlike pvp heavy games the atmosphere is much better with warframes coop approach than many other games,60
overall a very enjoyable game especially if you want a relaxed and easy going approach to a looter shooter in space without strings attached and no pressure either from the content or most importantly your peers,22
fun game to get into with a lot to do,-1
my recommendation is to just complete as many missions in the star chart as you can and enjoy the story quests that begin to pop up on the later planets,38
the second dream and the war within are probably the two best pieces of content the game has to offer in terms of story and cinematic experiences,-1
as for other content plains of eidolon and fortuna are awesome as well,38
in short its free to play if youre interested give it a try,0
its not for everyone but id always recommend trying it,20
who knows you might like it,16
warframe was always there for me when i had nothing else to turn to,-1
i was merely making a jest about how warframe took a lot of my time and money and was very fun,-1
thank you concerned commenters for making me have to put this update,12
i will say this game is an amazing free to play,0
having friends i will say is key so join up and make some as its a very friendly community and playing solo isnt as fun,36
if you love mmo you should love this game as the gameplay is great unique  both in story and content awesome community the freedom is great  customization missions,-1
ive personally played for the story and find the universe that is placed before you as a player is one of a kind,18
this is a game everyone should have or at least try out  as its free to play and is amazing,-1
firstly thank you for taking the time to read this review and i hope it finds you well and educates you or helps you decide if you should get this game,40
i have been playing warframe for a good few hundred hours on ps and thats why i only have a few hours on steam and i am absolutely am no expert on this game but i believe i can provide some good points for this game,-1
warframe is a incredibly grindy game that often needs lots of time and motivation to complete certain tasks but it does the grinding in a way that i think can still be fun whether your a new player a player thats pretty knowledgeable of the game or even a veteran player since day the grinding can most definitely be time consuming and sometimes tedious but i think the reward and feeling you get for completing something you have been working towards is amazing and very gratifying,-1
warframe isnt the game for everyone but i believe if you are looking for a long term game it is definitely a good pick,19
in total i do really think warframe is a good and unique game with all its systems modding playstyles and the somewhat wholesome community there is to find,19
this is an excellent free to play game,0
in addition this game has alot of parkor moments and alot of hidden places to find and go to,9
in a way this game can be very grindy but with each frame offering  differing powers and a differing look and considering you can choose whatever weapons you want it makes this game have alot of replay ability,14
all in all i recommend this game,13
they are continualy updating and fixing thingsthe newest frame called the titania is alot of fun to play,-1
sooo in conclusionplay this gameits free after all,0
great game and still one of the best free to play out there,0
as i was kinda bored recently i decided to revisit the game and oh boy it really does have evolved so much after all these years,-1
still that fast paced ninja action good graphics and great gameplay but everything have been greatly improved and perfected,5
movements are ultra smooth very fast paced weapons are really satisfying honestly its an absolute blast to play,9
theres so much content and so many things to do in this game,53
but if you have the time if you are willing to get involved and also if your not against doing some research to learn the different systems in the game trust me you will get hundreds of hours of fun with warframe,-1
in this game pretty much everything can be acquired for free except some premium cosmetics,8
anyway overall warframe is a pretty good game which i highly recommend,19
an interesting and fun rd person shooter game,22
highly addictive and recommended,21
an amazing game,-1
best fp game,10
best community,4
aha,2
hope,74
ah,2
but you have won,-1
in my opinion the greatest fp game of all time,10
no content is locked behind a paywall either which is pretty nice,8
good game to play tho especially while listening to music or watching something on the side,15
been playing since open beta literally as soon as it popped up,59
i still enjoy the game even if the grind is rather immense,3
there are some good well a lot for the most part,-1
the graphics are really stunning the lore is coming together and turning out rather good,1
the clans are good as long as they remain active,75
you can actually make some good friends here,4
theyve introduced some interesting things over the years,-1
in short its a grindfest of a game but it is still rather good,3
enjoy it but dont burn yourself out as i have,-1
a very briliant game with crazy advance movement,9
combining between ninja and shotter game also many kinds of cool weapons,5
and the best thing is this game is free,0
only a few hours in seems p interesting,7
grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind,3
i like umbra excalibur,-1
a true fp no paywalls definitely recommended for those who love grindy games,8
better than destiny,41
better than destiny,41
i think a big part of me enjoying the game again is avoiding all the drama and not watching dev streams,11
practice keep up and get gud,71
i play regularly with friends and i am generally enjoying many of the changes de is making to their game,68
its free and theres a ton of stuff to do,30
immediately i fell in love,16
lots of fun and probably the only game where its fun to grind,3
great trade community also with constant content updates,-1
edit  and still an awesome game to play,76
sure  edit hell yeah,76
its okay,58
free to play and offers more than anthem,70
ninjas play free and slay gleefully  warframe is the pet project of digital extreme the canadian development team that has been behind the unreal series bioshock and the darkness  along with homefront which was still a good game overall despite its many flaws,5
a cooperative third person shooter with impressive visuals and art style refined parkour and mobility options as well as an interesting take on scifi it is one of the most active successful and evolving game on the fp market,22
the game that it was in closed beta where i got the first chance to play has changed so very much that many that returns to the game today find it an almost completely different experience,59
from the game being now more approachable to having added many features that the community suggested to even revamping entire systems already in place for others that expand the gameplay greatly                 as a free to play game there is the required incentive for players to pay for things they could get for free by playing aka a time wall,0
i kinda like this game,28
this is not a late review  i just wanted to say that warframe still fun to play in,32
a great game and one of the best alternatives to destiny,84
awesome game,65
better destiny,41
if destiny was good,41
ride horse with gang defo recommended,9
so warframe is overall a good game for a fp  with enjoyable combats awesome graphics and all those weapons and frames that you could get,82
its true that warframes coop missions are repetitive but it is still an impressive title with those awesome devs this game is totally worth a try,60
really fun but the grind is tough,3
sci fi fast zippy zappy organic robot space ninja samurai go brrr make smooth brain generate dopamine serotonin oxytocin and endorphins,5
collecting premium money is possible in the game cool gameplay nice graphics good optimization,8
the game is very interesting,-1
excellent graphics  the plot is cool  they monitor the game and often update and add something new  i definitely recommend the game,1
if you are into cyber space ninjas running fast and killing things then this game may interest you,5
great graphics some of the best combat ive ever played and although its a grind its a good grind,9
hours in pretty good game so far,7
oh boy,2
theyre smart,-1
the combats pretty fun,9
if youre a fan of being moble youre going to love this game,-1
the enviorments i feel have the most love out of anything else in the game,63
if youre still interested in warframe go for it,-1
i reccomend it overall,25
fairly addicting with a moderate learning curve if you want to get good,21
decent community with many players helping others,4
third time playing the game in  years but first time i actually got addicted to it,21
it definitely improved immensely over the years not to mention tons of new content,12
unlike other online games playing in public is mostly painless and doesnt require much communication so this is actually the first game i actively use public matchmaking when im not with friends,36
but friends are still important in keeping you invested in the game i started a tiny clan with a couple of friends and weve all surprisingly stuck around for a couple of months now,75
becoming a trader was probably the other half of what got me so attached to the game being able to make an insane amount of platinum opened a lot of avenues to get new weapons frames and mods,48
all in all an amazing freetoplay game where the premium currency can easily be earned via trading and without spending a single cent,-1
a better and free version of anthem,70
this game is just fing awesome and i mean it,23
highly recommend it you wont feel let down,25
product received for free  steam labor of love award,17
a gamers dream come true a great playground with dream movement options dude im flying,9
do what you want play how you want pretty much feel free switch playstyle anytime missions randomly generated very enjoyable to replay np if you fail grind etc several modes  ninja on steroids melee is as fine and fun as ranged all the movement options combos and mods shootemup dope sniping without magazine reloading make yourself so dakka dakka gunslinger that you start gently pressing fire to not waste your  magazine  hack n slash make enemies look and act like fools max paynes bullet time kinda metal gear solid sneaky session on steroids jump heavy slams slide n slice thru enemies bullet jump strike piercing thru enemies wall latch stick yourself anywhere spiderman  heroes to play so far lots of weapons toys and mods  plenty things to do learn try explore collect clear unlock craft mod  long development and good studio,47
new open world area added  not a wattereddown lazy consolefriendly game fast pushed in your face   a dope game close to perfect in every way pretty much yea not story driven etc arcade playground variety replayability,38
have to say game learning grinding or controls are not that complicated no worries at all goes with time,73
great fun,61
its clearly still beta as the game offers little information about how to actually set up your character luckily the wiki is superb,59
loads of classes and even more weapon variety,31
some  hours of gameplay in and  years on its still fun,7
these identify the different classes of ninja with unique features useful to customize the game experience,5
these enhance the efficiency of its warframe but not only,14
you delay and do cool spins,9
grind heaps,3
tonkor is awesome,-1
success,34
oh wow for once i actually need rubedo now,3
game is the best free to play game out there,0
nice game i like it,-1
one of the greatest examples of a free to play game done right,0
having more than a thousand hours on record i can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that this game is well worth picking up especially since you will never have to pay a cent unless you want to,-1
it has some small flaws here and there and getting well aquainted with its wikia pages is a must but otherwise it has a great dev team that stays well connected with is community,-1
good game play good dev and community great game for potato pc user  me free to play forever is possible,1
i kinda like this game,28

i think i found my new addiction,21
after years of grind level  collect stuff  fight enemies  fight game bugs  grind more levels  collect even more stuff still one of the best coop multiplayer space ninja simulator there is imo,5
you should give it a try its free its good with friends or without,30
choose your warframe pick your weapons enjoy the interesting and evolving storyline the looting slaying,14
product received for free  its quite good for being a free game,17
cool writing universe and decent enough twitch shooter mechanics,22
fantastic game great integrations with twitch responsive and passionate developers,11
i like it,16
the people in this look funny,6
if youre up for the grind and are ok with looking at more than a few wiki pages itll easily be one of the most rewarding experiences you will have in a game,-1
the community is generaly very friendly and trust me everyone else had those questions too,4
the developers have created a game where farmers can have a good time while blasting off the heads of enemies,35
what more can one want,-1
the best part about all of this is that it isnt pay to win,8
warframe is my only girlfriend,26
some of the female characters look really sexy in this game,1
meet some of the friendliest people ever,4
my friend showed me this game promised me we will play together,15
thankfully i met amazingly kind players and thanks to them i enjoyed the game even more,-1

highly recommend trying again if you havent for a few years,20
the gameplay is fun  unique fluid and fast paced,56
this makes it extremely satisfying for players to traverse the maps,-1
in essence  the game is premised around becoming a better player with the use of acquiring rare mods and weapons,31
the road to becoming a warframeexpert can be time consuming however its fun and offers plenty content to explore and enjoy,-1
most of all the developers of this game continue to provide content on a regular basis to grow its fan base even bigger,-1
highly recommend  pros fast and fluid gameplay unique and offers a variety of playstyles for all player types very rewarding to players who put time into the game,47
yeah its pretty aight i like it,29

its very rare that a fp game with a model like this keeps my interest for over a few minutes but ive been playing warframe for  hours within the first day of downloading it,-1
really surprisingly quality and wellpolished combat as well as loads of different mods and abilities makes for a really entertaining game overall,9
best scifi anime space ninja armor fashion simulator  and hoverboards  and spaceship battles  and mechs,5
warframe is a straightforward game at heart,-1
thats the premise digital extremes started out with almost a decade ago of this writing and its still the core gameplay but over time they have added ever shinier loot prettier environments to magic cyborg ninja your way through and wound up weaving an intriguing world around it,5
missions can be played in public pickup groups or with a private inviteonly group or solo the warframe community remains one of the nicest online communities im proud to call myself part of,60
if thirdperson coop scifi shooters are your thing at all this one comes highly recommended,22
its a good game for everybody who likes grindy looter shooter,-1
a great crusade to take your friends to and just rememebr its free to play but its a damn good fine lookin one with alot of action,15
best free to play game,0

beautiful art,1
fun pve,78
the community is the best i encountered in a mmo,4
grinding is relaxing for me and is rewarding making it easy to acquire premium currency trough a well established trading sistem,83
clans and forums are really friendly with new players and youtubers make great and fun content for pve and endurance runs,4
so if you want a relaxing community and a relaxing way to play an action shooter this is the best,24
i have been playing this game for a while and to be honest its really good,-1
this is the only game of which i always find myself returning to after a while and then getting instantly hooked again,-1
this game is clearly amazing on a lot of aspects,23
the graphics are astonishing the gameplay is exciting and fun its challenging a lot of times etc,1
overall though it is really worth playing it and can be really fun and interesting,-1
first  hours awww lotus is such a nice character,-1
shes so kind,-1
but damn do i love this game,28
the gameplay is so buttery smooth the gunplay so tight and fun the melee slick and gory the parkour and jumping and sliding and gliding and backflipping all of these merge into an incredibly fun experience that keeps me coming back even after months of hiatus,-1
its also a rather generous game in terms of freetoplay,49
its very fair and logical even if it takes time,8
this is the only freetoplay game ive invested substantial amounts of money into and i dont regret it at all,49
they keep adding stuff and improving things,12
the graphics are gorgeous the music and sound effects excellent and the gameplay oh man,1
i love how good i am at this game,-1
my friend got all the content ive been grinding for weeks in ten seconds,3
this game has lots to offer definitely casual friendly and always remember just because they nerfed something doesnt mean it is already the end of the world,-1
good luck out there my fellow tenno,44
great game to get into with friends,15
playing with friends makes this games  times better,15
i have done everything i wanted to in the game mr  and dont play much anymore logging in once every couple month or so but i will gladly boot up the game and slay out with friends any time,-1
warframe is undeniably one of the most satisfying experiences ive had with a free to play title,27
it contains an ever expanding arsenal of weapons mods and warframes that can be mixed and matched for endless possible combinations,14
the game also features a highly satisfying clan system including the ability to build your own clan hall which provides several bonuses besides the simple meeting area with cosmetics,75
and the great feature of warframe is that it always contains a challenge,-1
whats not to love,-1
grinding is very important in warframe,81
that said the loot system is surprisingly fair and it doesnt take much time to start building an arsenal of weapons and warframes to play around with,-1
warframe would be relatively forgettable if it didnt have its incredibly rewarding surprisingly in depth combat system,-1
melee combat is deep enough to stand on its own with a variety of weapon classes fighting styles combos and the built in mod system which allows you to customize the your warframe firearms and melee weapons,-1
however some are more interesting being able to change the functionality of your abilities or say allowing you to replenish your energy when taking health damage which adds a considerable difference to playstyle,39
you have your standard parkour system with wall running slides cliff hanging flips rolls and the like which combined with the weaponry and the individual abilities of each frame results in incredibly engaging immersive combat that supports a wide variety of playstyles,9
altogether if youre looking for a third person shooter mmo with incredibly strong gameplay and a fairly pleasant aesthetic and dont mind a bit of repetitive grinding i recommend giving warframe a try,-1
its good i guess,29
really great alternative to the alwayssamecallofduty in my option d and on the other side its freetoplay and seems to be completely nonpaytowin,49
does this be even better,-1
there are many cool things about this game space space magic space ninjas space dogs spaceships lasers energyfields space cats floaty space pet robots invisibility space fairies space zombies space grind space resources planets asteroids bows crossbows shotgun rocketlauncher pistols space,5
the crafting is central to warframe and is excellent,-1
its easy to understand and very well designed indeed most importantly there isnt the slightest sign of rng anywhere in the craftng,-1
thank heaven,6
levelling up has been very well designed,-1
the really clever part of warframe is that the gear you make never goes obsolete,14
you just upgrade and mod it until its as good as it can be then it remains with you for life so to speak,12
the really important part of warframs is building up a solid collection of mods for your gear,14
comparing it to borderlands the balance of the game is far better,-1
as yet i havent seen any elitism which is refreshing,-1
are much simpler and really dont need any explanation at all,51
this means that generally pings are very good but can vary depending how far you are from the host  and what type of connection they have,-1
the game is definitely not pw or pp but it most certainly is more fun if you spend a little,-1
the advantage of platinum is that it can be traded between players so some exclusive items can be obtained by trading,48
its an amazing game,77
but having super frequent updates like that keep the game fresh even little things,12
its super fun,52
wasted my money on an xbox one and destiny warframe owns the competition hands down with no alterior motive besides amazing gameplay and a great coop experience,-1
tldr i recommend this game but with a big asterisk,-1
if youre planning on playing for free sure i recommend this game,0
if youre thinking about buying the new prime access or the latest supporter pack i would also say its worth it,20
ive heard this game is free dont complain a lot,0
approved by kushphil because i like,-1
one of the best free to play game on steam ever,0
still going strong  years later one of the best fp games i have played,10
proud member of the design council,1
after playing it for an hour or two i can say its alright,7
but in all seriousness its a fantastic game for those looking for a free to play that you can actually play for free easily,0
sure it can be grindy at times but overall warframe is just a great game to play,81
if youre just starting then get some friends to play with you to make it an even better experience,-1
however after watching guides and tutorials i quickly became engrossed in the game,51
playing warframe with a buddy is even more fun as you can help each other grind for items,81
the community is also very friendly and helpful,4
one of my favorite things to do in the game is tridolon hunting,-1
its incredibly satisfying to take down these powerful enemies in a short amount of time and it gives a sense of accomplishment,9
overall warframe is an enjoyable and fulfilling game that i highly recommend,19
product received for free  highly recommended,17
its very fun to blow stuff up and also to participate in the economy as the premium currency is tradeable,83
my wife said if this review gets  likes and  awards she will buy a case of beer guys help me out,40
pretty fun game they keep updating it,12
the game has drastically improved in the last year,-1
i am pleased with the direction the game has taken,-1
those were good six years with their downfalls and upbringings,-1
i may not return to this game in the future but i will never forget it,-1
thank you digital extremes for all your hard work on this game and good luck to everyone whos playing or thinking of playing warframe,26
dont give up yet you will find the good if you keep playing it i had deleted and reinstalled the game quite many times the real tutorial took hours but it deserved,-1
was the best update the developers ever released,12
they introduced characters with actual personalities and background stories which can be explored indepth which brought so much life into this game,18
i am enjoying talking to these characters a lot and look forward to experiencing more stories with them or getting more characters introduced this way,-1
the good  gameplay is fast and satisfying,56
best free player game on steam,0
no free player bring this amount of amazing content for free and allow players to costumize and trade free in the way that warframe do,27
you can get everything without having to pay,8
paying only make you get stuff faster but you not have to pay a penny to get amazing content,8
warframe give you a freedom to do and try out things and they support their players with daily login bonus and awesome event contents,-1
and the best of all  developers are updating the game so fast and boost it with new content that it never ever get boring,12
there is always something to do for you,-1
,2
had a little fun,61
good community and gameplay,4
the game is fun to play solo or coop,24
slow start but great game with s of hours of content,53
i would say though that if you come in with an open mind as someone who just plays hoping to get right in there and gives it some time to speed up anyone can love this game,13
mostly because theres a lot of grinding  still a good game,3
amazing game the graphics are beautiful the gameplay is fun and the story is interesting best of all its free with no microtransactions required to have a good time,1
warframe is the best truly fp looter shooter on the market,82
new players will find a massive amount of content released over the years,12
to this is pretty damn cool,6
in conclusion warframe is a great game to get into as a new player and even as a veteran i cant complain as i have over  hours put in and still log in from time to time and keep up with the new stuff on the horizon,-1
dadcals  is the solution to all of lifes problems,-1
all jokes aside i think the game has one of the most welcoming community,4
ive been given numerous items from mr  playersweapons rare mods a complete set of a nova primefor free,17
almost to the point where theyre eager really,-1
whatever these developers did was magic,11
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
this game is awesome,23
the gameplay is the best of any game in this genre that ive ever played,-1
story is great only a little sad that it starts really late,18
but if you like the gameplay enough than the start of the story feels more like a reward for your efforts,-1
the community of the game i also great,4
willing to help when you ask,4
so the game devs also apreciate art that is made of this game,1
the graphics are still amazing to this day and the developers keep updating the game constantly so youll almost never run out of things to do,1
its a really grind game which i really enjoy playing,3
if you dont have the money to buy destiny or similar games i would really recommend this one and you would be surprised that you might actually enjoy this one more than you would with the other games,84
the developers has to earn money some way and its a nice element to the game if you want to support them,-1
i highly recommend this game for the player that want to grind for that top tier loot,3
its fun,52
good gamee,45
people may say it is a pay to win game but if you put some effort into it youll start to get some badass stuff which is what i love about this game very fun,8
funny how ive spent more time in a game that is free than any other game bought,0
this game is very unique,-1
it is truely free to play because the premium currency is tradable,-1
for me warframe is a game with beautiful graphics i must admit game artists are very original and it keeps me hooked into this game,19
warframe developers are great they release constant updates every month sometimes even every week and game support is the best ive seen,55
a good point about warframe is that it doesnt require real money to become strong you can get almost all equipments without platinum real money currency anyways platinum is a great help mainly focused for players that lacks time to play,-1
it has outstanding graphics even on the lowest setting,1
to be able to get new items and characters in which they call warframes you can either buy them with real life money or invest immense amounts of hours into the game to get them which isnt that bad at all because the game is really fun,-1
the gameplay is terrific and the given ability to free roam each individual map is superlative,-1
if youre looking for a new game to play thats free and not to mention fun then warframe is most definitely the game for you,27
if you heard any previous bad reviews about this game just remember it has improved a lot since its release date back in march,40
better than destiny,41
great game super boring at first but as soon as u beat all the planets the game really takes off,-1
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
best free to play game ever,0
probably much better than some paid ones either,20
pros  you can be beautiful  cons  starting out everyone is more beautiful than you,47
warframe is a deeply customizable solid game with amazing hightech weaponry many ways to tackle levels for all different playstyles and space ninja parkour galore,-1
you also need a good clan to start with otherwise its on your own and you will stay clueless for awhile once you start understanding i think its worth playing and investing your time in,75
best fp game ive personally found has held my interest for going on a year now,10
frequent updates usually every other week better than average community and is easily the most polished despite an official release fp ive seen,12
highly recommend,25
however in spite of all that its still one of if not the best free to play game available with a unique setting and story what little there is and amazing if slightly dated art design and graphics,-1
yeah its a grindy game full of rng and spending too long on simple things but its still the best one of its kind,3
warframe oh boy warframe one of the better free to play games id say,27
really fun addictive gameplay  vs  pve enemies basically lol and it really takes you down a power trip,78
said gameplay makes the absolute grind that this game can be fun,3
enough variety in mission tiles the story after a certain quest gets impressively unique,37
normally i dont talk about the music but my god this game has some pretty tunes we all lift together has to be my favorite it really helps set the vibe for the quests,-1
warframe has the best microtransactions system ive seen with the premium currency the platinum being able to be exchanged in the market for parts other people can sell to you making the premium currency accessible to fully fp players with the downside that you need to find people to sell these things to the website warframe market works perfectly for this,-1
so as long as you have prime parts mods or some ayatan sculptures you can always get pl without paying for it and i think thats really really good,8
funny how ive talked about the micros more than the actual gameplay lol but it had to be said i love this game and i love its way to handle microtransactions,-1
reasons to play warframe to feel like an awesome ninja to feel like an awesome robot to feel like an awesome martial artist to feel like an awesome marksman to feel like an awesome archer to feel like an awesome swordsman to feel like an awesome mercenary to drown in content updates  pretty sure the dev team has adhd or something my goodness they cant sit still for a minute,-1
most companies are down for sitting around on their latest update like yeah we did a good job meanwhile at warframe hq the dev team is like done this update gotta make a new one go go go  the game feels so good plays smooth as shaved balls,55
everything feels good to do and even if it bugs out a bit its generally entertaining to some degree eg,-1
honestly not many im sure computer strength can be a major issue but its fairly good for the most part mid grade computers should be fine at like  fps on reasonable settings,1
long story short lots of fun watch your wallet its tempting so so tempting,-1
a little grindy but its pretty good,3
the games environment is well designed,-1
this game is better than other scifilike games,22
this games really welloptimized,23
as you start to get into the story missions it gets increasingly cinematic and engaging,-1
it has some of the best lore locations and npcs ive ever dealt with in an online game and its insanely wellmaintained as well as constantly updated,18
the customization is fun and engaging,39
overall i highly recommend warframe,-1
public review on behalf of the opium pulses steam group  few words about the game  game is truly absolutely amazing,40
its too good to be free to play really well made game with nice attention to all those details,0
warframe is fun to play doesnt matter if youre playing with friends or alone comunitty ingame is friendly enough for you to find your place there,60
fast paced game that includes wallrunning flying in space and developing your character,5
has been around longer than destiny has been better than destiny and will continue to be better than destiny,41
its a freetoplay skinner box grindfest but also extremely fun to move around the map and there are probably  different paths of progress to be grinding on so you can always feel slightly productive,3
warframe is a game that ive played on and off for over five years which is almost a recommendation by itself,-1
freetoplay it offers a staggering amount of content and doesnt force egregious microtransactions on you every step of the way,49
you can play a good portion of the game without having to pay anything although most weapons warframes and the like take considerable time to build,8
perfect for gunning down fools in a couple missions or in chunks of hours warframe is a good time all round,-1
and its fun,52
in style,6
theres a story sprinkled in there which really comes into its own further on into your experience from second dream onwards and it has an interesting universe to explore,-1
focus on the little things,-1
find a weapon you like a favourite frame that suits your playstyle and work your way through the game,14
the impressive thing about this game is that theres almost like different games within the game,-1
theres the clan side of the game where you can drop a tonne of resources credits and building a dojo your mamma will be proud of as well as getting more blueprints for more stuff,75
it has flaws every game does but its a free game and it doesnt hurt to try it out,-1
this one is a favourite of mine and will be a fixture in my library for some time yet,-1
after over  hours of play and spending well over  on a founders package and several prime access packs i can safely say that this game will get its hooks in you and once it does its not letting go even when i take breaks from the game due to burnoutmore on that later i still think about this game and returning to it,-1
this games update cycle has been a journey from a very basic third person shooter with rudimentary and tacked on parkour to this fast paced frantic off the walls looter shooter it has been a very interesting ride,22
de keeps this game updated frequently one of the reasons why so many people stay and are always trying to pump new life into this game,-1
with all that said though the best way to learn about this game is to try it for yourself as a picture is worth  words the game is free so all youre losing is time,73
fun free fantastic,0
,2
suddenly a very high quality fp game,10
the game has a great variety of missions,37
interesting system improvements,-1
all very nice,6
,2

,2
,2
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
if you like space scifi parkour and ninjas this is your game,5
i personally like the quests and lore,-1
the modern romantic interpretation of samurai and eastern culture is strong but it isnt cloying and adds a nice lens to view the world through,1
overall ive gotten sucked into this game and am thoroughly enjoying it which is all i really wanted,-1
great lore a huge variety of customizable weapons pets and warframes and a seemingly endless timesink,14
its good for long play sessions or a quick void relic run before work,7
the friendly community never ceases to amaze me with the generosity and helpfulness,4
and devstreams are always fun to watch for the inside jokes and childish humor mixed into the cool content coming up,11
its very grindy but its very fun to play,3
good time,6
that sums it up its amazing,6
i have over  hours on this game,7
summary awesome game very wide range of mechanics indepth lore and creative storylines satisfying combat and amazing art,18
character customization is indepth and very rewarding,39
community is largely super friendly and helpful,4
suggest favouriting the warframe wiki though if you want to get good especially for endgame content,-1
creatorbase on youtube is very large so there is a plethora of tutorial videos,51
conclusion parkour spaceninjas utilises magic swords lazerguns mechs jetpacks and rocketlaunchers to destroy hordes of ancient aliens clones and robots while looking super cool,5
remember to pet your cat,-1
top  scifi universe that i was happy to discover,18
the quality of story missions and cutscenes is rising with every year,-1
great community,4
developers have a great skill of mixing solo story campaign and coop missions,24
legendary game that can run on slower pcs,1
honestly one of the if not the best game i have ever played,54
it is definetly worth your time,20
play to grind  grind to play   edit holy fugg you can fish now  edit you can play guitar hero and tony hawk now,3
fun with friends,15
grind fun,3
product received for free  no need for a long wordy review here,17
warframe in my humble opinion is absolutely unequivocally one of the greatest video games of all time,19
it is most certainly the best freetoplay game i have ever played and ive played a lot of apex,49
the level and quality of support these devs have always given and continue to give to this game is unmatched,11
they wholeheartedly deserve it,34
very good,6
really good game,50
for those who enjoy a good third person shooter,22
and they are all amazing,-1
and the movement mechanics the shooting mechanics the cqb mechanics all feel incredibly refined and make you feel like a bonafide badass at any point in time,9
and while it can at times feel grindy especially if youre looking for that one special mod or weapon part that you really need to complete a build the gameplay loop feels satisfying enough that you wont get completely bored of it and makes you want to try just one more time or just one more time again,80
and the developers are constantly adding new features to the game like new warframes new weapons entirely new game modes entirely new areas new quests new music etc,-1
and it is all free,30
how cool is that,6
pog,71
there are a lot of character weapons and a very nice modding system,31
the game has an excellent image quality,1
this game is a masterpiece that must be tried and recommended,-1
like destiny but good,41
i enjoy the game but im only able to get the most out of it because i began playing years ago and the new player experience has been saddled with a larger and larger backlog over time,-1
if you have the patience to progress through the game and seek external advice such as fan wikis warframe will offer you a satisfying experience with many goals to grind for,-1
but you will need a lot of time to get there and the game will certainly be offering premium purchases during that time,8
i enjoyed the new  content which still deals with abstract concepts but which is much more grounded with an appealing cast of characters,-1
warframe  a world of wonders,26
pros  despite being an old game it keeps getting better and better with new updates that improve graphics as well as gameplay mechanics characters are highly customizable and rpg elements make this game more interesting coop mode is fun if you have friends playing it highly optimised graphics and good surround sound its free  cons  i deleted this game for the following reasons my pc used to  run into a problem  most of the time during update process its pay to win kind of game  where you have to keep spending if you wanna survive in the new maps,47
match making takes a long time and inspite of that end up playing with bots   i still recommend this game for it being much better than most aaa titles and for being free to play,-1
this game rocks,23
and its all coop fun,24
on top of that the community is helpful and friendly,4
while the grind is long and endless you can make meaningful progress whether you play for  minutes or  hours,3
the devs a bunch of goofy canadians are in constant communication with the players they stream several times a week with nice loot drops host drunk dev streams every couple of months with no shortage of lewd jokes and innuendos and are actually likable and funny,11
overall warframe is a great example of how to do fp right,82
awesome fp game and the developers are constantly making it better every week,10
the gameplay is unique and original and definitely addictive,21
i love the grind,3
this game is soooo well made,23
its the best free to play ive played,0
its a fun free to play yay,0
i love the way you dont even need to pay out real money into this game to get that epic gear you want,8
good work de,-1
you love grind,3
this has grind  you love progression,3
this has progression  you love shiny toys,-1
this has tons of shiny toys,-1
you love endgame and challenge and pvp,78
something this good for free,30
this game really blew me away when i tried it this november,-1
i never expected a free to play experience to be this rewarding and fair,0
you dont have to spend anything to progress as everything is unlockable and tradeable,8
the story picks up hard midgame thats when i really started getting attached to this game it was a really amazing experience and im upset i havent tried it sooner,18
i think this is a game everyone should atleast give a try this is how free to play should be,0
product received for free  my main account is on playstation but i started a pc account to go through the the new war expansion storyline and as a challenge for using only excalibur my favorite warframe,27
it has a solid and interesting if not sometimes confusing story with only a few hiccups for progression mastery rank requirements for the star chart and obtaining a necramech without paying real money were both frustrating and took a number of days to complete,-1
its still really good though even if you arent into games as a service,0
my advice for new players who find they enjoy this game is to do everything you can to get through the story as soon as each element unlocks,-1
you get some incredible story rewards that you can use for other parts of the game that will make things much easier if you decide to become a collector or completionist,-1
as for the freetoplay nature of the game warframe is also excellent imo,79
everything else you can get for free if youre patient and dont mind grinding,-1
theres even some stuff you can only get through playing which is neat,-1
i luv space mommie and space mommie luvs me,5
the game that keeps me going throughout the years,-1
gotta agree with potatogamers review in most helpful,1
from the old void and reward table system to this new relic one i see a massive improvement in rewards and less reliability in offsite resources to be able to get what youre looking for,-1
not to mention improvements to trading and communication warframe really has tackled many of its issues and the developers dont seem to be afraid to rethink things and go outside the box,55
granted ive only just recently gotten back into it im still very impressed with how far its come and how much has been added,-1
i almost felt like a new player again upon my return thats how much was changed yet all of the new additions were intuitive and by the end of it i felt better about where the game is now compared to where it was when i stopped playing,-1
for a game thats free and not paytowin you really cannot go wrong,0
open world  parkour  grind a lot of grind  one of the best fp games on the market,10
one of the best games that has a story in space and its thirdperson mode and its challenging stages i recommend this game to everyone and my opinion about this game is  out of,22
its also value for money,20
product received for free  when we had raids it was fun ever since than its just managable to spend some time on this game,17
grind is for real real fp no need to spend at all and you can get everything by just playing and spending a lot of time,3
good luck tennos,44
for a free game i had a lot of fun playing this,0
its better than i thought it would be,-1
the gameplay is great,56
it plays quite well even with a steam controller,0
the parkour while feeling kind of limited it makes you feel like a badass,9
now mixing parkour with a thirdperson perspective and you are in for something epic gory and fun that is free,9
things called mods lets you customize the strengths of your weapons which makes combat much more easier on higher rank enemies,31
a lot of levels and worlds to check out,-1
yah  over and all i cant recommend this game enough,13
ive poured my soul into this game and its been a fantastic run,-1
this game has outstanding graphics and the optimization is solid,1
the gameplay and the ingame movement and parkour is a really fun addition to the game and really makes the game fast paced at most times the game still does have its dull moments,9
for a free to play game youre getting so much gameplay and you can really pour some serious time into this game currently at  hours atm,0
even with all the bugs though i always find myself coming back to this game,-1
the customization is also really something else,39
you have so many different options for skins armor pieces and colors that you really can make your warframes stand out even amongst the same frames,-1
if you really like a frame you can mod it to the way you want to play so you can really excel at what you do,14
you can pretty much tune your frame to the way you want to play so theres so much freedom with making your builds,14
theres so much more i could say about this game but all im going to say is its definitely worth the time and money ive put into it,-1
you will get it,16
good luck tenno,44
let the endless grind begin,3
i like herion,16
this game is great,23
great free  play game  totally addictive,0
this game brings many new ideas and exciting coop play extremely interesting,24
i bring honor to komrade and babushka,-1
this game i love this game teach you patience and farm tekniks to make good situation out of no situation,28
absolutely gorgeous game graphics,1
runs so smooth on my pc just a very enjoyable game,1
like the character and weapons upgrade options totally customizable for your style of gameplay,39
its alright i guess,72
awesome coop with friends cool grafics and gameplay,24
best game,64
this is definetly one of the best fp games on steam,10
fast and exciting gameplay lots of stuff to improve and customize your equipment unique amazing graphics and tricky challenges complete warframe a universe of its own,-1
there surely are still a few bugs in it but the devs are doing a real good job on this game imo,-1
they care about their community take feedback seriously and constantly release new content to improve and extend the gaming experience,11
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
love,16
in my upmost honest opinion this is the best free to play game out there if youre looking for a high quality game great graphics regular updates with new content and a nice community too then this game is for you,0
no need to pay to win as everything here is pure skill and gained through experience,8
the game layout is simple to understand and the map is huge with two open worlds to explore both of which include a way to create and name your own weapons and modify them to your guns and melees to you own ideals,-1
i honestly can not say a bad thing about this game i first played on ps in early  and fell in love with it straight away,-1
,2
,2
,2
this game is honestly one of the best freeplay games ever made,0
youre a ninja and you around killing stuff in sick moves and great graphics,5
great game and i love the way it is set up,-1
highly recommend,25
,2
but by so far the community is amazing,4
a bit grindy but insanely fun once you start getting new equipment,3
i played it a bit before it was on steam and the game has changed a lot  for the better,57
i started the game in   very nice game  beautiful game nice and interesting gameplay many things to do  and its free so just go try it and see,0
do not let the bigots who are review bombing this because of pride month ruin the rating warframe is a good game with good story and a good grind some people dont like the end game grind but when you have nothing else you will get sucked into warframe,19
good game,45
ive been playing on and off for almost a decade and every time i return there are heaps of changes and fun things to do,-1
the game is not without its faults but depending on the kind of person you are there is an infinite ceiling of fun to chase after,-1
the is phenomenal and finally ties everything together,-1
now that its in place i felt like giving a review as its one of the best stories i have played through,40
product received for free  its never been more fun to be a space ninja,17
i havent played this game to much but i gotta say its really good,7
for being a free to play it has very nice graphics but of course it comes then with some market stuff like buying money starter packs and those kinda stuff,0
to settle that its a real fun game to play with your friends but you got to have patience,15
its actually a decent game finally has cross save,-1
make it bigger in the next update please,12
its the best free to play game ever,0
if you dont mind the grind then there will be an insane amount of content waiting for you,3
warframe is a mediocre singleplayer experience but a great multiplayer experience if youve got a consistent cast of friends to play with,60
for a freetoplay mmo the grind is manageable and the stuff you can buy is always stuff you could always just grind for,3
gameplaywise warframe has come a long way from its humble beginnings and now you actually feel like a badass space ninja with even the simplest movement combos and combat actions,5
the soundtrack is excellent,-1
the visuals are stunning,1
warframe really has an extremely dedicated crew,-1
the storytelling is very love it or hate it,18
im in the latter camp i think they execute the story excellently,18
wowwee,-1
weaponsskillsninjasrobots in a combination to a masterpiece called warframe  good storynice gameplay and an increadible among of features that only grow as the time pass,-1
pretty cool,6
fantastic ftp game,10
definitely worth your time,20
de succeeds in flying colours with having the most fairly monetized ftp game out there,10
give this game a try it is definitely a wild and fun ride,13
warframe has lot of potential for future because of the developers continuous support for the game good community and diversity of gameplay,55
my personal first week experience was full of learning and thinking how amazing this game was and the new upcoming content sounds very sweet to experience,-1
new content every month or two keeps the game smoothly fresh to play every time player logs in,-1
tenno yes i want,44
good,74
warframe is an amazing free game best ive seen yet mind you ive only been around for  years when i first started playing,27
community are so friendly you join a clan and theres a high chance theyll donate you to give you a boost,4
characters or frames have really unique design not only that theres tones of gameplays like stealth dps support tank and speedrun,14
its also open world not only that the story mode is so dramatic and it really captures your thoughts,38
get the game itll worth your time also might be a bit slow at the start,-1
my son got this game for christmas from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing,-1
i asked my son for help and he helped me,4
loved it as it was the best time had spent with my son since my wife had died,16
this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well,-1
this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,63
thank you,6
i always wanted to be a space ninja,5
good game,45
very good shooter with a lot of depth complexity and content,22
regardless id recommend giving it a bash its a good bit of fun at first but nothing i can see myself playing in the long term and spending money on,-1
,2
nice,6
accept the grind praise the grind become the grind,3
there will always be more grinding to be done and i sacrifice my life for the greater good,3
fabulous game casual friendly loads of stuff to do and keep occupied with,15
currency system is top notch and doesnt gate you from the gameplay in any form,8
it seems like the mod drops are a bit different on the pc version but its still a lot of fun,-1
the more people you know the better its always fun to play with friends,15
they are great at listening to constructive feedback and actively make changes to improve the game,11
warframe is a loot grinder and its very fun,81
update fashion frame is op,-1
this game is extremely addicting once you understand the endless things you can do on it,21
good thing the level layout changes every time for the same mission,37
awesome gameawesome graphicsyou spend some hours in this game i can guarantee this,1
my wife said if this review gets  likes and  awards she will buy a case of beer guys help me out,40
one of the few popular games on the market that isnt a dumbed down consumer experience,-1
it rewards and even encourages theory crafting and the build diversity is massive,-1
after so many years since release still one of the best free shooters around except for the pvp part which is not worth mentioning for this game,0
beautiful graphics shinny lightning effects,1
the game has a very strong player base so if you dont have any friends online to have fun with you will sure get strangers available anytime through the matchmaking system,36
warframe can literally offer you hundreds of hours of intensive gameplay adrenaline rush and fun solo or coop,60
it also has an interesting though somehow short personal story you must follow through to finish the challenges quests develop your character and access certain function and abilities for the playing character and for your own spaceship,18
after all the game offered them those thousands of hours of fun for free,0
the multitude of tasks and missions will surely keep you busy and entertained and if farming is your specialty get dem argon crystals boys even better,35
as much as the game may get repetitive you have several quests to take care of and soon you will discover the actual storyline going on behind that will end up getting you even more addicted each one of these quests unlocking new features such as having your own companions to aid you in battles,67
as i am a sucker for high quality graphics and detailed landscapes warframe left me breathless,19
from smooth ship surfaces to rough asteroid tilesets and robotic designs you will never get bored of looking around and telling yourself these graphics are totally slayin it,-1
long story short if you wanna be a space ninja alien thingy shoot and slash things be bombarded with a ton of game lore for you to piece it together see pretty things or just brag that you have the prettiest frame fashionframe ftw this fp is definitely for you,5
this game is extremely addicting,21
most people are extremely friendly and helpful,4
this game is so much fun,-1
very good game to play with friends and you dont have really to pay for warframes and weapons since you can craft them,-1
a little complicated but a very nice game,-1
better than destiny,41
there is so much to unlock and work towards,-1
you actually feel powerful and the rewards are worth the time put into them,-1
i highly rate this game it is the best fps game i have ever played  out of,10
if you and your mates want some fast paced coop action tons of loadout options lots of character options smooth gameplay great visuals customizations up the wazoo,24
this everexpanding rd person shooter can provide countless hours of carnage and a sick collection of characters and weapons that can be upgraded and modified to suit your gameplay styles,22
solo is good,36
coop is fantastic,24
id like to see more developers take a page from this book in regards to making coop more exciting,24
throw in a few more types of battle formats like arena fights for instance maybe a little vehicle warfare space ninjas on hoverbikes would be the bees knees the current maps that are playable in the game make for good instances but a more open world approach would help bring more gamers to the scene without question,-1
,2
a free game with indescribable beautiful graphics,1
,2
,2
and it has great mechanics,56
this is honestly the most relaxing game ive ever played,-1
yeah theres thousands of micro transactions but everything you buy can be farmed or earned by daily rewards and any warframe or weapon bought cant be used in pvp which is a terrific modal for a game,-1
the combat system is very exciting and makes you feel like a ninja in the sense youre totally bad ass,5
every warframe has their pros and cons and finding the best warframe that suites your play style is what makes this game insanely fun,-1
try forming dedicated groups out of pugs as much as possible to keep social and youll have an amazing time,36
this game is a true definition of masterpiece,-1
warfame is a very fun game where you can play by yourself our with friends,-1
i am glad this is free even if it wasnt i would buy it,30
still the best best gaim evur,-1
fun with friends worth the grind,15
you can go fsssssht and blaaaaaam and gagagagaga  so really its pretty great,38
best free game ever,0
this is a great tutorial on how to make microtransactions fair,-1
i like this game however imo after a month or two of inactivity you can really be left behind,-1
takes a lot of playtime and effort to its gameplay and movement are addicting,21
i recommend the game to anyone and everyone its free not pay to win but optional to smooth your grind out if you dont wanna grind that much and all items can be gained in the game except tennogen content those are made by workshop creators and the money earned from them are earned,-1
its a great game what else can i say,77
it is an awesome game everyone should try it,-1
,2
great game from release to now,-1
after playing for over  hours i can definitely say this game is way better than it was  years ago im glad that the devs are still working on this game and enjoying all the new warframes and weapons they have added as well the open world,-1
i will rework this review as i need to think about this more but making this for the steam norinate award task to finish and the fact that i should mamke a review on this game since this is a good game,40
warframe is a free to play game where you can play coop up to four players or solo if you wish,60
really great games and a lot of customization for different play styles and it gets updated constantly which is always a good thing,12
after playing for  hours im still having fun so thats saying something,7
overall i really enjoy the game and love that the game gets updated with new content so frequently,12
im quite surprised at how far along this game has come along,-1
the graphics have gotten better and the gameplay while repetative has also gotten better as the beta has gone on,-1
if you enjoyed games like mass effect  multiplayer gears of war horde mode or any other type of game where you and your crew of  take on endless waves of baddies in pure coop awesomeness sprinkled with the loot grind of dungeon crawlers like diablo or torchlight then you will have a blast with warframe,-1
luckily everything can be gained in game with some rng luck and time as well as the in game won from missions currency,8
all in all a great game definitely worth checking out,13
the community have so far been really nicce and helpful,4
i approve,16
this game is pure awesomeness,23
longest farming run ive had was only a few days with my truly fun casual clan,35
there are pretty much  paywalls in the entire game aside from frame and weapon slots which are extremely cheap,8
the nearly weekly updates also shows the dev teams determination to keep the game fresh and their dedication to the game and its community,11
great job digital extremes,42
warframe is a refreshing take on the squad based rd person shooter in its over all game play and especially its art design,-1
while not every gamers taste i find warframe to be a refreshing take on design,-1
the characters and aliens are unique very inspired and striking,18
my compliments to the art direction and the whole team,1
the gameplay is tight responsive and franciticly exciting giving the player the experience of feeling like theyre a true space ninja,5
ive found myself coming back to this game over and over again ever since a friend got me into it way back in june,-1
its one of the most open to all ftps out there,10
digital extremes really did this game right give it a try and you wont be disappointed,42
yes this game was taking my life,-1
oh boy where do i start with this gem  warframe is not just your average rd person action freetoplay game,-1
it is also a growing playable universe that is very easy to be fascinated by,-1
every year the team at digital extremes introduces a new gamechanger that is the equivalent of a game sequel and integrates it into the core game,42
the current warframe is the result of over six years of nonstop hard work and a dedicated fanbase,-1
now its a compelling cinematic experience its got two open worlds with a third one on the works over  craftable characters to play as daily and weekly challenges with endless rewards a huge variety of enemies to dispose of and an upcoming space battle game mode that will increase the scale of the game to never before seen levels,38
and the graphics keep getting improved over time,1
as always the coop element is crucial nothing beats the experience of a full team of  space ninjas each with their unique powers and weapons wreaking havoc among hordes of unlucky enemies,5
and everytime you succeed at crafting a new weapon or warframe it is bloody satisfying   one of this games major downsides is the chance that youll feel overwhelmed by everything the game has to offer during your first hours on it,-1
the game makes it very easy to communicate with people and find out what your next step should be,51
the games story is also becoming more elaborate and epic as time goes by,18
there are many surprises along the way and whats in store for the future looks very promising,62
theres a particular revelation after many hours into the game that every gamer should experience as it is truly incredible not just in terms of worldbuilding but also how it affects the perception of the whole game,56
long story short if you got time on your hands and youre looking for the ultimate coop action experience do not think twice and try warframe,60
pretty fun if you like to go fast,52
would buy again much fun gud game,71
one of the best fp game ever,10
if you like fast paced crazy wall running while shooting this is the game for you,9
slide into the wonderful world of warframe and join a community of gamers who have helped build this game,-1
awesome game,65
its okay,58
amazing game  it is even more fun if you play with friends,15
warframe is an awesome and very well made fp game,82
the game captivated me from the first minute,-1
the different combinations of weapons warframes companions as well as enemies mod combinations missions and content make the game exciting and challenging,14
its also fun to play with friends,15
the community is super friendly and nice,4
clear recommendation to play and enjoy,13
i can honestly say im pretty hooked now,21
i really like it,16
for a free to play its very good for almost everything can be bought or better yet built with patience the forge and mats,0
but im proud to say that i have a rhino warframe chassis currently being built and it will be completed early in the morning,-1
its like having a new toy in the morning waiting  so im excited i found a new addiction and am enjoying myself,21
you might too its free and ill link the very helpful videos below,30
i feel like warframe is in a much better state now,-1
i really enjoy what i have played and it looks like they are really delivering on the narrative and gameplay completely,1
i am still not a big fan of the grind for open world stuff but the rest of the game is good enough to give a good recommend,3
buy now for the low low price of free that rights absolutely free so whatre waiting for,17
free to play at its finest,0
fun game with countless hours of content,-1
devs that are actually pretty good as they listen to the community most of the time,11
lots of variety in the available content,62
game is completely free as is all new content added the old stuff usually sits there gathering dust for experienced players but for new players is usually worth going through to get the rewards,0
for a fp game i am proud to say that i have been part of the community for a few years,10
digital extremes has put tons of effort and hours into the game to make it enjoyable and playable even with the minor bugs that pop up every so often,42
a solid game with some story to it however if you just want to have a game where you can be a space ninja that guns down slices and murders everything then look no further,5
whether you enjoy solo play or team play warframe is a game that fits all needs,60
great game boring at lower levels but gets really and i mean really addictive as you progress in levels and in the game,-1
it has fast paced gameplay and immersive environment,56
overall a good pick for shooting game lovers,22
i love the game they gave me back my account after i did a request,-1
in my opinion this is one of the best free games,0
great grinding game great graphics great development team new things to explore all the time by the constant updates,3
pros easy to jump in and play but still very deep good progression system doesnt force you to spend tons of money to enjoy the game  cons no challenge later on terrible and confusing new player experience,47
one of the best free mmos that exists,0
i just love this game feels like a bad ass version of mass effect without the exploration and story,-1
best of all its co op,24
one of the perks is that the community is friendly and players are always willing to help one another progress through the game,4
warframe is a better game than it was before,-1
watching every single devstream jumping on the hype train every time it had departed it was a good time,11
i grew up with warframe and it grew up with me,26
thank you steve geoff and scott for the countless hours of fun uncalled for nerfs well deserved buffs and the amazing story and gameplay loop,-1
good game,45
this is probably the best free to play game in the world,0
and it keeps gettin better,-1
nice,6
no problem ill survive and see the abyss itself,6
amazing game for a free game its gorgeous and fun to play,0
warframe beta set in an interesting artistically styalised universe warframe is a rather compelling rdperson shooter mixing gunplay melee and unique abilities for an overall enjoyable actionpacked if not slightly lorelacking at the moment experience,14
yes it lacks depth of story for now but doesnt pull much away from the games great visuals and beautifully individual artstyle and design,-1
its free and its definitely worth trying out,30
,2
recently ive come back to what seems to be one of the most expansive changes ever,57
this game has me completely hooked in so many ways now,-1
at least its better than destiny,41
from a game that was just horrible at launch to become the best free to plays on the market well done,0
best mmo,-1
of course i will because its damn good and fast action game,13
its about team work and you would not miss it because it is not like other games like pay to win,8
ive had so much fun in this game it is simply amazing and impressive,-1
an interesting concept with nice asthetics across the board to boot and fun gameplay,-1
in all it was a fun experience to be part of and still is today,-1
edit things got fixed for the most part,76
games back to being fun again,-1
make the game fun,46
warframe is love warframe is life,26
warframe is a great game with a great community with a great development team,-1
warframe has been around for years since  and constant updating always makes the game exciting,55
a great plot of land is combined here with bright graphics rich contrasts,1
the game world of warframe is full of the most extraordinary characters thrown into the game space from all parts of the galaxy,-1
the game is extremely dynamic,-1
you can use parkour which complex elements allow the player to overcome obstacles and countless traps,9
managing the character of the game is very convenient,-1
the physical component of the struggle brings only joy,-1
the number of characters are showing a great deal of variety,1
turning the role over the player will definitely find the look and performance in which he feels confident,-1
the game has an impressive selection of weapons accessories and supplies to help the player achieve their goals,31
another unquestioned advantage of warframe games is its multiplayer project,-1
but even one player can and will find a lot of interesting things in the game,-1
the key to success in warframe  a high level of performance graphics,-1
other than that this game is great and i love this and i like the community,4
it definitely makes you feel a valued player while playing the game which is getting rare with the new era of gaming,-1
thank you developers and the ever welcoming player base,4
i have been playing this game since very early beta,59
i can say that through the years the game has evolved into a legendary title,-1
this is to say that it doesnt have its flaws or anything but it is without a doubt a great game for grinding game lovers,-1
warframe is a great game,19
it has good mechanics and gameplay,56
it has a great community,4
overall it is good for a free  play game,0
the endless amount of possibilities playing this game make it great for me and my friends to stay busy and entertained,-1
ive had lots of fun teaching them what i know and all the tricks ive learned,51
ive recommended this game more than anything else ive played and its exciting to see what else de is going to come up with,68
played few minutes it kinda makes fun,46
the game is still fun,-1
just dont rush in too much and your time is gonna be good,-1
shortly after i found some people who were interested in me and even my problems we created a clan and more people joined us,75
we are like a happy little family,-1
i continued for  years as of now and so many amazing things happened i created a huge dojo just so people feel at home here,-1
i got people out of depressions by letting them feel welcome by us,4
all of these things happened with great joy and when i left for my brain surgery these people cried for me,-1
i went through my own depression in this game i found love in this game i found a family in this game,63
if i need to explain warframe in one sentence it would be come for the game stay for the experience  thank you for reading,-1
product received for free  best value for money since it got the best content and constant updates for a free to play game and one of the best gaming communities i ve seen  with a player base from kids to senior citizens across the globe this game is a world within itself and a dev team dedicated to its fans this game is successful coz of them and the players who had to persevere the test of time and never ending bugsvisually amazing nowadays easy to run on potato pcs and with its ever expanding arsenal its a game perfect for anyone,17
,2
its good,29
best looter shooter game for sure,-1
been playing this for  years and the game keeps getting better with each update the community isnt toxic and there will be people to help you out or answer your questions regular updates of new weapons and warframes hours of vapouring slashing mincing and burning your foes and theres a crap load of farming if youre into such stuff which is fun when you play with friends,-1
the game has changed a lot over the  years and it is still bound to change for the better,57
good luck tenno may the void guide you,44
x,2
ive played quite a while on this game and warframe isnt simply another fps you need to add to your list because its freetoplay,79
this game offers a great opportunity to spend a great time with your friend and have fun while doing it,15
its really addictive since you get started to it with large sets of missions including base defense survival boss fights or killing everyone in the map,-1
thats pretty great yeah you can queue up with anyone no matter his level but when a warframe level  comes in with his crowd control skills that annihilate the whole planet while i still try hard to get one headshot on that small robot that survived the apocalypse its kind of a buzzkill when i see i killed  while he got,-1
but then again to get the most fun out of this game invite some friends and do your missions the way you want it done,37
if you enjoyed the mass effect series in particular this game is an excellent substitute until bioware gets its act together,-1
the graphics the gameplay the controls really cannot stop you from playing this grinding game,3
tenno out of tenno best game,44
product received for free  best play for free game ever give it a try,17
,2
,2
the game is awesome,23
it one of the technically bestmade games everdont need a huge pc to run it fine and almost dont crash or have anything going bad,1
besides this the game is visually stunning and all the controls interactions and such works like a charm,1
everything is really well made including the voice acting,-1
the cgs where marvelous but thats it,10
as i wrote before to me a plot is very important and having none is sometimes better than have some halfbaked one,-1
so this makes warframe a unique game,-1
anyway since the developers are always creating new content for the game and keeping the game well and evolving something that i really admire and its very hard to find in other games ill keep with warframe,55
the relics system and the possibility to play stealth solo instead of running the map like a gazelle just to finish the mission under  minutes with a team all the time is actually fun,-1
in the end this game deserves a thumbs up to honor its outstanding qualities,-1
warframe is an incredible experience and while its definitely a massive time sink its the best among them,26
been playing this game for almost a year now its one of the best games ive ever played,-1
although there is a ton of grinding the amount of content the game has makes up for it,3
with a great variety of frames and weapons this is definitely one of the best fp games out there,10
the games not as pw as people make it out to be the game is very easy to progress through when you get the hang of it after the initial start,-1
tldr try the game out its free and is about robot space ninjas,5
this game is awesome but too addictive if you dont know how to control yourself dont even think in playing it,21
but what i saw was fun,-1
its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no tenno has gone before,44
but a couple of months later i decided to give it a second chance and it was the best thing i couldve ever done,20
i started playing it again and started farming playing meeting new people and i also started doing quests which i think are the reason i still play warframe today for that rich lore and when the second dream came i knew that i was in love with this game,32
it turned into my favorite game of all time and the best part is that this is a completely free game dont let people that say that warframe is pay to win fool you you can get anything by playing or you can support the developpers and buy some plat because this game really deserves your money if you can afford it,-1
please give it a try at the start it may look difficult but in reality it isnt you just need to play it and enjoy every single noobie moment that you might have you can learn how the game truly works later and youll so accomplished by knowing how does this game works,73
i know this might no be the best review but i just want to support this game it really deserves it,40
yeah this is addictive,21
my overall opinion is genuinely positive about this game as its great to see the developers actually put time and effort into making the updates,12
id recommend the game regardless,13
its a tons of fun specially with friends,-1
good free game,0
started playing warframe some years back and though there has been breaks over time i keep comming back to play it and it is always a pleassure to see the developers passion for this game,-1
gud,71
great game,50
one of the few thirdperson shooter games that i found surprisingly addictive,22
the developers have been improving it for years showing that they really care for the game,-1
pretty good graphics and addictive gameplay  traversing feels smooth satisfying combat and looting is fun,-1
the interesting setting for the game and the mysterious plot have really peaked my interest,18
dont worry though there is plenty of guides to help you in this cosmic adventure,-1
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
totally awesome game,65
excellent game for excellent people,-1
,2
,2
ive only played a little bit but i like it so far,7
and i love it,16
,2
i totally recommend this game d,13
great for ftp the graphics fit the style and mood of the game,10
love the idea of my space ninja kicking ass and getting better tech,5
i love the alert missions which allows the tech that youd normally actually spend money on to be truly free,37
thumbs up,6
great artstyle great gameplay i love the melee combat and really interesting backstory or what is visible of it,9
i love the warframes and cant wait to try each one of them as they are all different from each other,-1
after  hours they just keep making this game bigger and better,12
after  hours this game is my life now,7
in a good way,6
still great,6
it is free to play game but you dont really have to buy the platinum paid currency at all as the playertrading system lets you get it fairly easily,-1
and even so after  hours and then after  more of pure fun i decided to put some money in  so far i have payed around  euro to the devs and i dont regret it in the slightest,-1
yes it is kindy grindy but the grind is still fun and thats whats important,3
if you love girls in tight sai fi suits youll love this,1
i love you because the implications in your universe make me want to know how people live in that setting,18
combat is a bit choppy but well done fp is one of the better models aside from a waittoprogress gear and a few powerful frames being locked behind absurdly hardtounlockbosses updates have been both fleshing out the content and the universe actual languages given to the inhabitants unique bosses that are less reskins and more something that actually challenges well entertains at least,10
a great game with good graphics,1
a good community that is always ready to help you figure something out but not without idiots,4
there are many interesting mechanics that diversify the game,-1
i advise everyone to play,13
this game is amazing,23
pve with ninja robots fairly easy to get into as well,5
i love this and its free,30
cool game can run at al pc,1
if you can get past the immediate lack of information then youll find a really fun game with some rather pretty visuals too,73
ive done everything i want to do on this game,-1
one of the best games available on steam and its free with a fair business model and has been improved and update with new content countless times since its release,0
its okish i guess,72
i could done something with my life with the amount of time ive but into this game,-1
a very fun rpg that i highly recommend if you enjoy fast movement solid gunplay building up an arsenal of weapons and exploring a vast world with many different factions and visuals,-1
but damn is it fun anyway,52
great game with the best developers in the industry,11
an incredibly fair fp system and constant updates,10
it will give you hours upon hours of enjoyment,7
played a little bit quite fun you can have a dog,46
still decent i like the game,-1
product received for free  if you dont have any games to play this game is the best time sinker ive ever played prob the best free to play ive played,17
from not being interested at all going to playing every day and achieve almost everything i can say that warframe is a game that demands so much of you but at the same you feel greatly rewarded for whats to come the grind can be a little obnoxious but if youre already use to it then you can get through with it,-1
i can tell a lot more of the great things this game has to offer but you have to check it for yourself only then youll know how good this game can be,-1
pd atlas prime my boy well play again one of these days,-1
i have found this game to be very well madeespecially for a beta game,59
graphics are great too,1
,2
one of the best free to play games,0
decent game,-1
overall good would encourage folk to play it,-1
get better to get more stuff to get better to get more stuff,-1
perfect game if you ask me if only i really wanted all that stuff and not just some or is it just me being lazy who cares,8
trippedout beautiful intense challenging strategic with incredibly welldeveloped depth and fun,56
really one of the greatest allaround coop experiences ive found,24
cant recommend this one enough to anyone ive ever gamed with,-1
especially when the final product is this great,-1
i heard from some people saying that this was the best fp free  play game out there so i decided to give it a shot,10
although this might not be the best of fps imo but its certainly one of the better ones,10
pros great community everything can be earned while playing the game except some skins farming is pretty fun major changes can be seen in the current game by watching some old videos gets better as you progress through the game gets more and better content over time free roaming areas waiting time to build something makes it more fun a returning player may feel as if hes playing a new game the game makes you try a lot of different equipment in the game limited time missions and events syndicates factions pvp  cons not very welcoming to new players a hell lot of farming which may seem like a chore after a while the first parts of the game are fairly boring,47
one of the best and most balanced games ive ever played,54
great game,50
,2
i like it thats why i recommend pls,25
nice graphics and a highscifi ske story,1
but is a nice game what make it nice is some adictiviness to unlock stuff how easy is to go somewhere and shot things and the diabloske mania of collecting upgrades,-1
product received for free  whats not to like about the game,17
only downside is not enough content but still an amazing game to play  bestttt game  the community in this game makes this game worth playing as a team,-1
this game might not be for many people but its a masterpiece,-1
all the characters are amazing in their own way lots of people say oh this character sucks,-1
ect but theyre all really unique and are really cool,-1
they also have really sick designs the primes are so sick and everything about this game is insanely cool from the lore to the characters to the playstyles and weapons,1
and plus theres never too little content to do theres so much content you could play this game for a year straight and still have stuff to do its crazy,53
,2
however absence it seems does make the heart grow fonder,-1
after returning i rediscovered something id forgotten from all those hours of playing despite its flaws warframe is at its core a genuinely fun game original review below for reference,19
amazing game takes a bit of grinding but its all worth it,3
i really recommend this game to anyone,13
keep farming tenno you may get the item you need in the next run or next or next or next or next or next or next or next or next or next,44
this game has a unique character design i love it they look like space dolphins to me d sexy game,1
its alright fun to play,-1
also the story is great,18
every time i came back the game is obviously better than it used to be which is surprising because its always been good,-1
i seriously recommend it to you as long as you dont mind grinding,3
everything except skins are available for free as long as you dont mind working for what you want and even the ingame currency is obtainable through player to player trading,8
thank digital extremes for listening to their community,42
great to play with some mates and is quite addictive,21
best of all its free,30
maybe once ive had enough of d ill come back to enjoy this game more,-1
this game is incredibly addicting,21
also pretty much everything can be gotten for free eventually,8
one of the most fun and fair fp games out there,10
everything you have access to makes you truly experience what it means to be a spaceninja,5
good video game for people without a social life,15
one of the greatest examples of a free to play game,0
also the principal line is wonderful and image quality very well,1
the most important thing is warframe dont need you to pay so much money for itif you are willing to spend free time to play it you also can be strongeri like it very much also we can make so many different skins and colour for our own warframe this game charm is has so many different playing methods we dont need confined to sole can create fun by ourselves why not join this game,-1

i think this game is fit for anyone who can respond quickly and learn fast because it takes some getting used to,73
above all its really addicting and with the game always changing at such a fast speed you never get bored,21
good work,6
this game has so much stuff to do that if you can find a group of friends,-1
youre solid,6
the community really is its best feature and the easiest way to avoid feeling burnt out,4
i do not even know where to start on this game other than to say that it is utterly addicting and literally the best free to play game that i havve come across,21
you have so many options in this games and so many different warframes to build that it is unreal and just what you can do with them is amazing enough,14
everything is so detailed and the possibilities are seemingly endless,-1
there are so many things you can do to your frame such as skins upgrading so many modsit is just unreal how many directions you get pulled in that you are asking yourself let me try this or oh hey i might be able to do this,14
and the part that i like the mostis you can buy weapons surebut the fact that you earn them is so much better,31
now dont get me wrongthis process can take forever and is a total pain in the backside but in the end it is so worth it because you actualy went out and farmed the materials yeah call me crazy,20
but all in all and in all seriousnessi seriously love this game and i wish i had found it sooner,-1
i highly recommend it,25
review update nearly a year later and im still playing this game weekly,-1
the number of updates and dedication to this game that digital extremes has shown is nothing short of miraculous,42
the sheer size and scope of this game is staggering,-1
not only is this one of the best free to play games of all time but i now consider it amongst the pantheon of my top games of all time,0
thanks digital extremes for making warframe such a great product,26
initially the game felt a little rough but it seemed promising and i liked how passionate the team appeared to be,-1
warframe has improved by leaps and bounds,26
this game is amazing,23
there is so much content with each update,12
there is no doubt that warframe is one of the best free to play games of all time,27
great game hours and hours of grinding,3
great game,50
product received for free  pretty fun,17
,2
this is awesome game for those player who want to play some space third person shooter by yourself or with friends,22
also it is really cool how game is constantly being updated,12
but i guess i would still recommend it,25
if you enjoy long treks through repetitive map environments for small pay and little reward then this game is perfect for you,-1
that said there are positives aplenty about the game,40
i personally only play this game because a very sexy kind and sweet idividual has seduced me into going through the long download and patching process to play with them,-1
then youll have fun with this game,46
its not my cup of tea but i appreciate what i see them doing and hope to see them succeed,34

product received for free  im poor and cant afford crap but it aight cuz i got homies to play wit  step  gather da homies step  play game,17
product received for free  i have played this game about  months more,17
after a week or so i liked it and i played a lot after understanding what to do or what you want to do its more of a casual game,-1
this game is kinda like farming things mostly but this way of farming is actually kinda cool and fun as this is more like an action game,35
this is a totally free to play game because you can farm good things to sell it for platinumas the most valued currency in the game and use that platinum to buy something even better or something you really like,-1
this is a game that girls and guys can play because of the variety of play styles it has it is a game for everyone,15
very good sir,6
good for new players for up to h id say,4
this is one of the best fp games out there,10
this is one of my favorite games the grafics are amasing and the voice acting is incredebel the cinematics and the quests are so well laid out and some miner bugs and glitches but over all its a good game,1
still the best fp game to date if not one of the best games out there,10
please destiny players give this game a chance at least  hours,84
warframe is the game that i want all destiny  retirees to transition to because its the powerscaling destiny player desire and more,-1
theres so much content,62
like so much its insane and all of its free,30
theres a dozen things i could gush about this game because its good,77
please destiny players either find a warframe vet to help you through the ropes of the game or go in blindly but please give this game a try,-1
its free so you wont regret it,30
i played warframe some years ago and i have recently returned to it,32
the good    great graphics,1
incredibly fun gameplay,-1
generally stable with a decent ping and few connection or lag issues,-1
easy grouping and quick access to quests,67
a moderately interesting story mode,18
conclusion   a fun game well worth playing but with limited longevity,-1
i absolutely love this game,28
if you like grindy games and are easily entertained like i am this is the game for you to try,3
the best part i like about this game is its free to play,0
eveything is free in it,30
but this game is good so i say give it a shot and i bet youll enjoy it,13
yes,33
,2
a great game for any tps fan,10
its refreshing from what it used to be but the grind is still there new mechanics are being placed in old systems are being rebuilt anew,3
it still feels fresh yet still the same it feels nice,-1
,2
its made my top  favorite games of all time,54
one of the best scifi storylines to ever exist in a game,18
amazingly fun combat system that has completely removed any desire to play a fps ever again,10
the most customization ive ever seen in any game,39
big fan,6
the best community on the internet,4
the community is the best i have ever seen,4
people are helpful and kind and funny and its a place where you can go and feel good have fun and just relax with a bunch of good people,4
its a fast paced action game thats never felt grindy to me,3
thanks de for an amazing place to be in the gamerverse,68
okay maybe it is what i have always wanted,-1
nevertheless do i love this game,28
it has a lot of action and i am sure you can release your rage in here very well,-1
awesome sound effects and other aspects give this game a great athmosphere,1
play it  farm it  enjoy it  farm your life  it never stop,35
best fishing game ever would recommend even if sometimes the neighboors come and make the fish flee,13
its like destiny  only free and much more better,70
lots of farming but its fun with friends,35
amazing game amzing devs and i cannot recomend this game more,-1
its still pretty good,6
one of the best t e n n o o b,-1
this game is ok,-1
almost every day new updates are incomming wih new interesting features,12
i spent money on this game and i dont have any regrets because i like it and hopefully i can contribute something to improve this game,-1
lol  warframe isnt the bad type of grinding game,81
and the base progression rate are fairly acceptable,3
but im willing to be patient and make that concession to keep the rest of the game free,0
the upgrade system for both the warframes and weapons is good and effective,14
theres a huge wiki with plenty of data on it,62
the amount of content is crazy,62
this game is one of the truest freetoplay game i could find,49
makes you so happy when you finally get around parading with it,-1
but hell this game is a lot of fun to play,46
best free to play game  i didnt played free to play games that much but my friends recommended this game and i tried it actually you need to spend much hours on this game to understand its mechanics there is no beginner tutorial for this game to learn its mechanics but the grind is real  if you love to grind that much its best game for you some people dont like grinding some have less time to play so they want run and gun but i got much time these past days so i spent more time on this game to grind i played some grinding games so it wont bore me at all this game got released on  and the devs keep supporting it  overall its recommended game those who love to grind hard,3
having played quite a lot for almost  years i can highly recommend playing warframe but only if you have got some time to get into it it is slow to get started but at an enjoyable pace if played with a couple of mates that can quickly get you through your first few missions mods and a new weapon and warframe to venture out on your own with,-1
it can be a bit of a grind getting everything you need to get that new frame or weapon that was just released but again when played with a bunch of friends and you combine your missions for everything you team wants to get it is a tonne of fun,-1
i think they are getting a bit complex now  but the devs have always done an awesome job of not only adding new content but making sure that they can please their fan base while trying to enlarge it,12
the live dev streams are also pretty cool,11
very good farming simulator,35
best game for never giveup gamer,0
in the end its alright but consider how much time you spend on it because you could have a lot more progress in most other games from an hour compared to warframe where an hour is almost nothing,-1
warframe is a game ive been playing for quite a while now and have spent the amount of time necessary to get into it,32
it does take quite a while but its worth it over time,20
the game has a growing number of missions and environments to explore and wellrounded equipment to choose from to match your play style,37
surprisingly this is actually a good thing and actually enhances your experience,69
i must say that as a freetoplay game warframe is a nice surprise that sets the base for a promising future of freetoplay games,79
finally done the tutorial guys,51
a good free game either you like it either you hate it,0
tons of fun,61
new content with many planets to explore,38
this game is way too good to be true but it is true,-1
product received for free  one of the few fp games that show how its really done,17
warframe is literally a perfect game,19
good gameplay loop hilarious devs and positive community thumbs up for de for making this great game,80
warframe is amazing free  play playing,27
nice game to play with your friends  i recommend this game,15
the devs make memes and let me make meme builds therefore i am a happy man,11
great game with devs that care about their community,11
fantasticbeautifulamazingso much lore and discovering new weaponsenemiesframes,14
i just love playing this game soo muchfavorite frames are voltnidusvalkyroctavia and nova prime,19
really a great game,-1
i love being a space ninja hehe,5
warframe is an excellent game,19
i highly recommend it,25
i really like the different quests and animations,67
i love warframe its the best free game ive had the chance to play so far,27
warframe est un excellent jeu,-1
it is a freetoplay cooperative rd person space cyberpunk ninja simulator with a fair business model and flashy graphics with a development team that actually supports and listen to the community the gameplay can become a bit repetitive but that is because grinding is also highly involved in this game but i can assure you as everything in this game can be obtained without spending any real money to it it is in my opinion one of the better freetoplay games out there that will kept you interract for a very long time indeed,5
this games is so fun is like destiny but for free and more fun to play this characterswarframe is really fun to use,27
i have not had this much fun since i discovered tf,-1
warframe easily takes the cake for one of the best free to play games on steam,27
theres a nice balance between what you can get without paying a cent and buying stuff which imo is what makes this game so good,8
i was always a sucker for thirdperson shooters and this might as well be my favorite,22
the controls are laughably easy to get into after an hour i was completely used to it,73
and now with the new update  there is an new and better intro to the game,12
a game where the devs support it every year new characters new items new weapons new worlds new companions new missions new bosses new mods new things new balances or not xd new posters new ayatan treasures new statues and like every week update,-1
we are talking about the updatehotfix simulator award and the i love it from the first day till this day award,35
a lot of things to get to build to upgrade and it gets better and better,-1
this is the go to game,23
if you enjoy fast paced third person shooters with story elements and an allure that keeps you coming back for more at least once a month check out warframe,-1
warframe is one of the most if not the most addictive game out there,32
the concept of space ninjas appeals to me like nothing else and the scifi elements combined with the delicious graphics unique story plot weapons ninja abilities and ability modifiers make this game happen,5
hi just like to say that the game is awsome,23
down right the best free to play game ever,0
english and italian review recensione inglese ed italiana   english  prefixing that the steam game time isnt correct and that is since the first closed beta that im a member of the warframe community i guarantee that this game is awesome,-1
ive been watching it growing up being developed step by step with the improvement and the progressive addition of contents,12
what about the graphic is great and also the gameplay,1
its based on teamplay as every good pve has to be and the variety of playable warframe and weapons in constant increasing is impressive,-1
trust me and give it a try possibly with some friends you will not regret,20
this game has very satisfying improvements and events,-1
but its so far that planet i need to go no problemo just write to chat recruit tab lf looking for taxi to  planet name then someone takes you to somewhere in the planet u wanted to go,-1
warframe is an awesome free to play game with so much to offer,27
the new eidelon update has really opened this game up to so many more possibilities,-1
i found fishing and mining quite enjoyable while just sitting and wanting to waste some time but it also can be quiet addictive,21
the selection of warframes is so vast and easy to switch out as you need them so you are not bound to one frame the whole time you play,14
the customisation of each frame makes eah and every frame very unique to another players which i feel is really awesome,14
the clan dojos have a great deal of potential they are at the moment a great place to gather with your fellow tenno but are quick lacking in decor and functional items other than the labs and training rooms giving the grand scale of the dodo a very empty feel,75
but if you like slowly working to better yourself both through practice and striving for better equipment this game is a fantastic investment of time,-1
being free helps a lot but digital extremes are fantastic devs whove made this fp game probably one of the most consumerfriendly games on the market,0
i often find myself buying platinum the premium currency and packs of goodies just to help support the devs,48
on top of that the gameplay loop itself is fantastic and fastpaced,80
would i recommend this game,13
in a heartbeat,6
the game gets better after  hours trust,7
its freeplay and is not paywin along side of a really good community and devs that says it all about the game,0
you wont regret it,20
now if you like all of those types of games warframe is your game,19
my nomination for labor of love and my most recommended game to anyone that appreciates a great community devoted developers and an expansive universe,-1
every character has unique abilities and can make a difference on the battlefield,14
while this game may not be the most innovative or the best looking its something to keep you and your friends entertained for hours on end,-1
one of the best and funny games ive ever played,54
i am a new player with almost  hours spent on playing this game and its magically amazing,-1
no words with all the work behind this,-1
beautiful story good mechanics and farming isnt that boring like other games this is just funny to play,35
i cant thank enough to de for making such a good game so ill keep playing and enjoying new updates and incomming features,68
i fully recommend playing this game,13
after  hours of gameplay its amazing how it can go from nothing to just have a lot of things,53
i still enjoy the game i love that farming never ends and i love that the de team keeps working on new updates and new features and missions,68
you can get bored doing something but you can still do a lot of other things to enjoy thats one of the main reasons why i keep playing this game,-1
hours i still love this game,7
especially since they keep adding new things,12
i might come back to it eventually i do like it,16
very fun gameplay story is rather interesting,18
and overall the game is legit pretty satisfying,23
i do recommend to give this game a small try,13
perhaps you will also love the gameplay loop,80
this is one of the better free to play games,0
i dont regret the  hours it was enjoyed,7
i love this game i think is the best for now,28
product received for free  if someone tries to get u into this gamelikely how you ened up here tell them to only help if you need any this game is nice to experience,17
my madeleine de proust love this game,28
i have been playing this game since the begining and this game is fantastic,-1
visuals are spectactular animations simply beautiful,1
with the game focusing on the mainly pve aspect this is a great game to play with your friends,78
and its all free,30
its good,29
every cent worth it,20
the best fp game on the market,10
its not a perfect game but the core loop is so much fun you can loose hundreds of hours without even knowing,80
also it has a great community and the developers are very active with them and post regular updates that are all free,-1
still needs some polishing and refreshing content to keep you hooked but its an incredible game with better graphics than the newest aaa titles,1
definitly worth trying out and keep up to its growing array of content,-1
if you find this game on your own and happen to like it it will become your favourite game of all time i have been playing this for just over an actual decade at this point,-1
if you wanna give it an honest shot dont be afraid to ask the community for help its complicated and confusing but omg is it fun,-1
however outside of a few community made cosmetics you can get pretty much everything with enough patience luck and will to grind for some components,8
very well optimized compelling and unique grafics truly a free to play game,0
its okay,58
has kept me entertained for over a thousand hours of my life plus  extra hours accounted for bathroom breaks,7
unbelievable that this game is fp i am a returning player and so far nearly every aspect has been improved upon,10
i recommend this game d community is super friendly and welcoming,4
good mix of sweaty tryhards which i might fall under and casual players and anything else on the spectrum all coexisting and having fun together,-1
with over  hours in this game i love it i strongly recommend it,7
product received for free  this game is very fun if you can get past the slow introduction lack of tutorials frequent bugs on updates and waiting about  hours for any real story to start,17
the community in this game is very supportive and will typically help you if you are stuck,4
warframe is hands down the best fp mmo out there,82
this game was created perfectly both storyline and gameplay wise,18
of course with every fp game there are parts that arent the best but the premium currency platinum was made perfectly because you dont just buy it to obtain it you can also trade for it with special items called prime parts and the marketplace to obtain platinum is player hosted and by that i mean that the marketplaces price can fluctuate and will fluctuate,48
warframe also just received its biggest update yet and my god its amazing theres a hole new place that pretty much is minecraft,55
but seriously check this game out,-1
dream,6
better than destiny,41
i wont spoil it but the story starts after  hours and you will like it if you bear with it till then,18
or use amazing special abilities that you cant use in any other game,-1
,2
firstly warframe have one of the best gaming community i ever saw,66
second developer working all the time for making game better and keeping everthing stable,11
and third this game has everything you might expect from a real fp game,10
if you looking for sifi ninja fps game that allow you to play with every single hero in the game with using every single weapon without paying money and getting help from nontroll community mate you are in the right place,5
warframe is a game i have recently clocked my th hour in and i can now safely say its been worth all the time spent,-1
pros the game is filled to the brim with content there is simply so much to do you wont be bored for the first  hours for sure,47
the best thing is that you unlock more content as you progress especially storybased cinematic quests are really interesting which you unlock much later in the game,67
customization is great you can make your own warframe just like you want it using colours and armor pieces to customize the looks and so called mods to tweak the abilities of your warframe,14
this makes the game a very personalized experience,39
the community is great if you ever need help with anything just ask,4
more content coming there is still so much coming,62
innovative game for people who love the grind like me,3
perfect for two monitors and netflix although you should probably refrain from calling nezha a trap lest the fury be rained down upon you,-1
combat is and always has felt fluid and fun particularily if melee is your lover,9
great game to play with friends its overall great fun  just dont focus to much on the grind and you will be able to blast through it,15
amazing game plus it is free making it even better,0
i highly recommend this game as it is fast paced and be played coop or competitive,24
enjoy c,6
this game will get you addicted,21
everything about this game is gold,23
practically everything in this game can be earned though your own hard work and buying extra stuff is optional that is if you want it right then and there,8
i love it,16
its the best fp ever,10
despite this many tutorials exist online and are rather easy to find so whether the player decides to carry on the journey to learn the game themselves or follows tutorials is purely on them,51
this game is very unique in its freetoplay model,49
the game and all content are unlocked and acquirable through hard work,-1
you are rewarded for playing and challenging yourself and as this is something rarely seen in games with such a large playerbase it sets warframe apart from other mmorpgs,-1
how much you achieve depends entirely on how much time and effort you put into the game,-1
you can get even cosmetics for a little bit of effort,8
warframe has excellent security and bot management which results in an enjoyable gaming experience for all players,19
you can customise almost anything and reflect your character and weapons with colors you love it has a detailed combat system many enemies a lot of things to do as well as different playstyles which appeal to a broad sample of players,39
i recommend this game from the bottom of my heart it has been updated in the right direction over the years ive followed it with developers listening closely to their playerbase,-1
it is one of the most popular games right now and kind and caring developers with a gift for attention to detail are the main reason behind it,-1
,2
,2
,2
this game is freakin sweet if you have the desire to level things this is the game for you,-1
its so much more,-1
the opening of the game is going to be rough for any new tenno but if you can find a friend to help guide you through the rough spots and get you into the beginning of the story line a whole universe opens up with a rich backstory behind it,44
they just keep adding so much more to this game,12
find a friend that plays and have them help you through the start because its so beyond worth it,-1
product received for free  this game has come so far since my first review,17
an experience quite unique to everything ive played before,69
the developers are very proactive and attentive to players needs hands down one of the best game companies out there,11
with all the scandals from other developers in recent times i am truly appreciative of the pure care and effort de has and continues to put into this game,68
there is depth detail and beauty here that only years of content and lovingly crafted iterations can produce,-1
fortuna is dropdead gorgeous,38
thank you de i will never forget this game and the toil you put into it for as long as i live,-1
it is unbelievably awesome,-1
anything that stand infront of awesome that is warframe,26
i love this game,28
it fun nice graphic but grinding is hard,3
after playing more than k hours yes i feel its the best stress reliever available in the market at this moment p and after the poe update there are two different games in one good job de,-1
free game enjoy,0
this game is so mindblowing that i have customise all my warframe and weapon till its like a god like stuff   fun when playing with people  you can be a ninja  many warframe to choose from  big clan dojo where you can have a blast in it  parkour those mission with your awesomeness,5
great game good graphics nice stories quests,1
recommended for people with lots of time in hand,-1
edit it still is the best free to play game i have love it edit  ok not the best anymore but still a great game p and will still recommend for the great developers they have,76
,2
it was worth every second,20
its good game but if you really want enjoy this game you need friend to play with,15
sweetness,34
i want to go to there,4
yes i can do that,33
steam asked me to review my previous rating because its been a long time since i posted it so here it is  its still cool,40
join me and hop into a warframe its time to explore,-1
there is always a weapon that will interest you be it a sniper to fire from afar or a bow to get those silent kills,31
sentinels are a great addition to the game each equipped with their own weapon,31
there is a warframe for each style of play so youll be sure to find a warframe to your liking,-1
the farming  warframe imo seems to be the game which youd love to play if you enjoy some fun sessions in farming for resources,35
each planet comes with its own resources one better then the other,38
all in all warframe is a great game,19
its something you wont find everyday and is defenitly worth it to take a look at and playing it,-1
warframe will be the game for you if you enjoy the joys of farming wich come with interesting missions special bosses for each faction and the joy of brutally murdering enemies in various ways with the different warframes abilities,19
havent played much but its pretty good,7
yes,33
better than infinity warfare and dedstiny,19
actually pretty good but without a veteran whos explaining and guiding you its impossible to play or come back to after  years,-1
would love to enjoy the movement and especially the great and unique artstyle once again one day,9
likes before my edit btw i am not the only one feeling like this  edit my veteran friend is back now and finally i can enjoy this game again,76
but its one of the best looking and feeling games of all time,54
the art design is godlike and belongs in a museum,1
the skins alone are of such an artistical quality its insane,1
and of course the movement is absolutely great as well it just feels great,9
and yeah i love it again,16
and hopefully this time ill learn enough to enjoy this in the future alone,-1
i like,16
best freeplay out there with no paywin mechanics a very dedicated and beloved development team that always surprises and spoils players with more than they can expect,0
i am a proud founder of this game and slowly roam towards my sixth year playing,59
,2
its an amazing and addictive game,21
plenty of stuff to grind for and its quality is better than some games that require money,3
pros its fun  a lot to do  updates pumped out every few months a great community massive arsenal to pick and choose from near everything can be obtained for free the trading system  cons grinding can be boring at times and cause burnout power creep  if you want more proof that its addicting look at my hours played  i stand by my points above however i have grown in my additional k hrs of play so ill be adding more  pros great visuals cool warframe designs fast paced smooth gameplay tons of weapons and frames to unlock hundreds of mods to collect frequent updates special events new content to look forward to not paytowin  cons cooperative online play doesnt encourages players to play as a team lackluster mission objectives a lot of bugs slow start insufficient tutorial too much left unexplained grindy and can be repetitive some weapons simply suck or are made obsolete by purely superior options peertopeer system can make games laggy especially when connecting to others in different countries  if you dont mind the grind the game can be a lot of fun especially if you can find a group of people to do runs with,47
if you enjoy fast combat and collecting tons of stuff then theres plenty of both,31
interesting game i like the ninja aspect of how the game tries to show itself to players and the graphics are really amazing,5
,2
with beautiful graphics great gameplay a variety of missions to complete many scenarios many bosses strong rpg elements good reasons to fight bosses and great coop gameplay earns this game a huge thumbs up not even considering the fact its free,-1
with events frequent updates and even more stuff promised it is a great game and i heartily recommend it,-1
this should be resolved with rare chances to gain platinum other than that this game is magnificent,48
update on this review warframes a gift that just keeps on giving,-1
its an amazing game with a bright future,77
waiting for cross save edit now the wait is over for cross save played a bit on pc i love this game so much  hours on console now clocking almost a hrs already on pc it is such an amazing expirience on pc well optimized aswell will take breaks from warframe from time to time but i will never truly leave this game forever thats for sure   otherwise gem of a game with a premium currency you can litterly earn by trading with other players,-1
you could be the best without spending a single penny,-1
honestly this is one of the best video games i have ever played,54
if you are a fan of mass effect than you will have a great time with this game,-1
everything from the graphics to the market to the battle mechanics of the game are all well developed,1
at first glance i saw that they provided a tutorial for this game which blew my mind away usually i have to figure out controls on my own with games but this game ensured that everyone will know the basic mechanics of the game and how to keep up with the players online,51

the game is fun,46
community is nice not many trolls,4
guys i finally finished the tutorial,51

warframe is and probably always will be the best fp game ever made,82
awesome game,65
even after  years of playing it all i can say is that i still love it,-1
i just wish i had more free time to play no further comments needed,0
with a sexy tight suit,1
then get this game its free anyway,0
great game main story missions are a bit buggy at times but its a great game,37
this is definitely a game to try out,13
great gameplay loop,80
a lot of fun for me,61
good game,45
warframe is one of my favorite games,19
still love it to bits though,-1
great looking game gota give them props for it to be fp with this kinda graphics and all my hours i played i had a great time and i hope many hours to come to myself and rest of you players out there,10
product received for free  ive played it a little its fine,17
warframe is an excellent game and that is putting it lightly,19
either way they each have their own unique looks and powers you can customise your ones to your own liking and desire,39
ive been playing this game for a good few years and it just seems to get better and better as the time goes on the developers add new content at a decent pace and keep us the consumer interested,-1
it really keeps me enjoying myself to fullest at every corner,-1
im refering to of course pay to play issue now unlike world of warcraft and other free to play games warframe does allow you to get the complete experience of the game for free they allow this by letting players doing the missions and farming parts of weapons cosmetics even other warframes you can build and obtain for no real money what so ever yay,-1
its a wonderful game and like i previously mentioned it keeps getting better to some degree d and as such i look forward to the future sessions of playing warframe that are yet to come,-1
would i recommend this game,13
hell yeah,33
no questions asked i think the majority of gamers out there would love this,-1
i love this game for its uniqueness adaptability,-1
it has a way of implementing different gaming characteristics into a very stylized atmosphere puzzles shooting stealth alerts parkour overall beautiful lighting and settings and character custimization,1
however the developers are constantly pushing out new updates that put previous updates to shame with the launch of fortuna they added a completely new open world map that looks absolutely amazing you can see the effort put into the details for the new map and i cant wait for the release of railjack,-1
update november th  railjacks are partially implemented in game i am already excited for when they finalize implementing gameplay for these railjacks and cant wait for empyrean  update march th  railjacks are still not fully implemented but we did just get a second wave of major railjack content,-1
finally we have corpus mission nodes for railjack,37
currently my fav fp game out there,10
,2
alot of fun singel or in public mode,-1
it just got a huge update,12
,2
the game is nice until you will farm everything you need and upgrade all the things you want to upgrade,35
its a tps that is realy fast paced its a truly original and nice concept game,-1
the waframes the armors the guns the melee weapons some of them are player made or player ideas thats just awesome it means that the creators are willing to make what we want to progride with the game comunity,-1
i must say its probably the best tps out there too much replay possibilities and too much fun for free,10
almost every item visual or functional is free to get you just need some friends and time to get them,8
fun to play no need to expend any money on it,-1
very well designed and fair freetoplay game probably the best one,49
constantly getting updated by the amazing devs that listen to the community,11
best game to play in co op,24
reasons to play  amazing gameplay and graphics  free  play  not pw  tons of content  a game where you actually enjoy grinding and farming,3
all systems and mechanics are fair and balanced  reaplayability value over   extremely fun with friends  extraordinary community very helpful and friendly  can make many friends  and many more,4
with an expanding universe housing a wealth of content the freetoplay game offers a stellar amount of freedom to explore uncover loot and take on missions with its cast of stylish space ninjas,5
this conceit of spacefaring ninjas slashing and shooting across the universe holds the loose narrative together while also giving you an impressive amount of freedom,5
several cinematic quests shed light on the history of the tenno leading up to some profound moments that reveal a surprising depth for your character and their place in the galaxy,44
however the trick to understanding this game lies within finding your own focus in the nebulous grindwhether thats taking on a variety of sideactivities and missions on a series of planets or investing time to customize experiment and tweak your favorite frames,38
it can often feel like playing catchup considering there is six years worth of content in the package but its a game that rewards taking the time to soak it all in instead of rushing through,-1
theres a staggering amount of activities to dive into and with over  hyperstylized frames to utilize theres a constant sense of fun and surprise when discovering how deep it all runs,9
there is a ridiculous amount of room to experiment and it can be especially fun strengthening one of the beginner frames with powerful mods and armaments that can melt through enemies,14
its also impressive how indepth customization and personalization is in warframeyou can apply different shaders accessories and even alter their particular animation set and its rare to find another player who has the same style and loadout,14
if youre committed to figuring out the intricacies of the game then using online guides to understand these advanced mechanics much like with other aspects of the game is a must,51
youll quickly find yourself in a rhythm of cutting down mobs of enemies and boosting your frames strength by collecting mods and earning experience as new gameplay systems and events open up,14
despite how much the game has grown over the years by adding in gamechanging features waframes roots are still planted firmly in its fastpaced and satisfying core combat,55
the overall speed and flexibility in its action is something that it continually excels at and theres a constant sense of grace and finesse that can make even the ordinary missions thrilling,9
it often shows similar shades to a fastpaced corridor shooter by way of a stunning characteraction game with your squad tearing through enemies using myriad skills and armaments,9
in a lot of ways thats what warframe manages to do best,-1
just when you feel like youve hit a lull a better and more fulfilling opportunity will likely present itself,-1
perhaps most importantly warframe makes sure that the time spent in its world is almost always well rewarded,-1
what else could you ask for,-1
gather with your ninja mates in one squad and go for the endless fun with killing and grinding,5
great game,50
its like left  dead except youre a badass ninja dude,5
great combat excellent art style fast gameplay,9
it helps and makes the grind more fun and you can skip parts that dont interest you,3
ultimately its a game that people worked hard to achieve if you think they deserve the money then its a winwin situation they keep making content you keep enjoying it,8
hands down best free to play experience that is currently available,0
there is a ton of fun content in this game and a slew of warframes and weapons to collect and build,-1
its great,29
i love it,16
product received for free  after  years finally reached mastery rank casually playing,17
this game is just my comfort zone,28
its so much fun thinking back after experiencing everything the game has to offer except for conclave and lunaro xd,-1
very proud to be a tenno,44
be aware that this game has a lot and i mean a lot to offer so buckle up and enjoy the bumpy but a very memorable ride,13
in the start of the relationship you love to hang out with them,15
the spice is back and the sex is amazing again followed by the grinding and the death of novelty,3
warframe is a free to play third person shooter game combined with melee combat and parkour system with great mechanicswarframe is one of the best fp games out there,-1
,2
warframe is one of those games thats a diamond in the rough,19
its a really great game only if youre willing to invest some serious time into it,-1
each frame has its own unique powers so its good to know how to utilize them for the right situation at the right time,14
now with the right modifications for weapons and warframes you can begin to merge the abilities together into a super effective fighting style but again that takes time,14
the fact that the game has multiplayer coop in it as well really helps with the later levels of this game,24
with the right team and proper weapons you can seem almost unstoppable at times,-1
but thats also the beauty of the design of this game,1
it always makes you feel like you can always get stronger without making you feel like youre invincible and you have to stop trying,-1
theres always something or someone out there thats just little bit stronger than you thats what keeps you going in your pursuit to improve yourself,-1
minors flaws and nuisances aside all and all its a great game and a good time thats definitely worth a try,13
even better when you bring your friends along for the journey,15
thanks de for good old days,-1
is very nice yes it is and i have shotted all of the aliaens,-1
too good to be free,0
best free to play game in the market given that the game has continued to survive for over a decade which is something you have to keep in mind,0
the game devs engage with players through regular dev streams with twitch drop rewards so be sure to at least claim those rewards they are very good they continue to implement changes to make the game better but you will burn out with how much content there is,11
the resources online to help with builds alerts reward tracking and marketplace prices for items are tailor made to make the game enjoyable and fast,8
i love this game,28
like everything isnt too long to farm i dig it,35

this is an amazing game if you just want to sit back and have a good time slaughtering everything in your path,-1
warframe is constintly puting out new content about every week and usually on wednesdays so veteran players like me keep getting new content to keep us working at it,55
i currently have over  hours logged into the game and im still very much enjoying it,7
overall once you figure out how to do most of the beginer stuff it is a very relaxing game,-1
it works out very well,29
if you read this whole thing i sugest you start downloading this game right now and have days upon days of fun,-1
warframe while it has a high learning curve is probably the best free to play and one of the best aaaquality games on steam,27
cool skateboard tricks,9
they need to release a sequel to the second dream in order for the game to be great again,-1
good game,45
well i guess its one of the best coop games out there,24

one of the best games i have ever played,54
graphics are amazing sounds are awesome,1
theres alot of stuff to do just all in one its so addictive and fun,21
still an awesome game,-1
for a free game it has a lot to offer decent gameplay tons of weapons and abilities interesting universe and somewhat interesting plot,-1
microtransactions are not greedy you can play for free for hours and hours without any problem,-1
i feel that if de could ease off on the additions for a while and focus on core game functions such as ai behaviour  that would massively make the game more interesting to all,68
when it flows and comes altogether  warframe is a shining example of how a pve coop game should be,60
if you can see past the endless and contrived drivel spewed out in the quests and instead jump in with some similar level players  it really is fun,67
absolutely amazing game all around,-1
i love it,16

i just thanks to them who make this free,30
becuase this games graphicgameplay all is best,1
i founded love in this gameplay it now,63
warframe is one of the few fp games were you feel its done very well,82
i was kind of lost for the first  or so hours but once the mechanics clicked with me i started progressing slowly through the game and im enjoying my time with it,-1
there is some lore and its something i wasnt expecting at all even though it isnt entirely throw at our face it made me curious to know more about the universe of the game,18
all the best games these days are free to play and that being said warframe continues to outdo the competition with consistent quality updates and content releases,27
this game sets the standard for a fantastic free to play game ive been playing for  years and plan on playing for at least  more,0
,2
,2
,2
,2
great game hard at the start but once you pass that learning curve you are sorted,73
update  so after a while warframe team got around and helped me by melting some of my flair to restore balance and got my account back,32
there was many changes over the years and it is still getting better finding new ways to enrich the game environment and im happy i can come back but to bad i already moved on to something else,-1
one of the most top quality games by a dev team that ernestly cares about the player community,11
ive been playing since  and i still love it as much or more then i did on day one,-1
and the grind itself is often more fun then tedious,3
in fact you can get anything without spending a dime if you really want to,8
its updated with amazing content regularly bugs are often fixxed very quickly,12
killing things in space its a great game i would have bought this game but ill settle for the dlcs if you dont have it you need it after all its free,-1
one word amazing the xbox  controler comp could use some work but its still amazing i absolutly love the coop,24
game yang super cool,-1
highly recommended,25
its pretty good i guess,29
solid game,-1
one of the real free to play games,0
you can really get everything that is in this game by just playing it and never spending any money it will take some time,8
and for the game itself its amazing but remember its still in beta so expect some bugs,59
the game is constantly evolving for the better by adding new game modes new frames new weapons and new features,-1
which are sure to keep you busy for a good while,-1
i am very new to this game but already i am enjoying it very much,-1
great coop game and lots of fun,24
one of the most entertaining ones out there when it gomes to free games,0
if you enjoy coop shooter games a lot then i recommend you give this a try,24
,2
,2
,2
truly the best free to play game on the market,0
it is a unique journey not for everyone but do give it a try wake up tenno,44
i dont know why i havnt reviewed this sooner but its a great game and fun to play although the farming can be a pain at the end of the day its totally worth your while,35
,2
after playing destiny  i can appreciate how much better this game is despite being free,70
with far better gameplay varities free content updates and mission varities,-1
this game is seriously the best free game on the market and i cannot recommend it enough,0
its a great game,77
if you want a hordebased shooter to just get lost in for a couple eternities then this is absolutely a game for you,22
once youve done the grind and the story which is pretty interesting theres not much to do except look fantastic,-1
my best advice is its free try it,30
if you enjoy the basic gameplay then its probably a game for you the gameplay only gets better and better as you go,-1
the true joy of this game is tinkering with their deep modification systems which few if any games have ever come close to,1
so dank,6
amazing shooter worth checking out,22
and the game is not bad at all,-1
warframe is something truly special,-1
digital extremes has put so much blood sweat and tears into this masterpiece of a game,42
the constant updates have kept me coming back since  and the game is only going up from here,12
if u  love fastpace actionshooting games  love futurisctic ninjas  love grinding while fulfilling other goals it is the game that suits you and define your passion  but if u feel  the game repetitive  hard to overcome the challenge  hard to complete the story of every planet then u kind sir are in dire need to seek friend to play with in this game not just randomly post bad review and leave bittertaste on everyones mouth,5
really good looking  a lot of lights and special effects for a freegame,1
tldr highly recommend this game top of my alltime favourites list,13
so my  cents about warframe  pros easy to pick up difficult to master storyline is gripping and side quests really add to the understanding of who you are as a tenno                  the devs have a great sense of humour the redtext update notices are arguably the most loved part of this game you should try get some of your friends to play with you when youre still early game,-1
its a lot more fun to play as a team and learn how the game works,15
to this day i still play with the person who i got into the game at mr and as a result of us learning how to do things together we can take on almost any mission as just the two of us,-1
you may find that another one suits you more,25
the warframe wikia site is very helpful often even higherlevel players will go to the wiki to check the drop chance of a certain part or where to go to farm another part pros and cons of a certain frame to decide whether to get it and so on,-1
the game runs well on almost anything and looks really good even on medium,1
overall this is a great game and the fact that its fp makes it at the very top of my list of alltime favourites,10
highly recommended,25
best game i have ever played,54
warframe is so amazing,26
its tough to get into it but once you do youll have a blast,-1
,2
yes,33
its pretty ok,58
warframe really does deserve its good reputation,-1
love it,16
the best game for ever,64
its darn good for a free to play title and it does that excellently as well,0
edit they changed course and personnel and won me back as a long term player,76
but id recommend it,25
but stick with it because the game really starts picking up,-1
played a little bit its pretty good,7
im still excited about every uptade and new addittions to the story and gamplay,-1
would recomend,25
,2
if parkouring all over the place and shooting loads of enemies appeals to you definitely give this game a shot cause it feels amazing,9
product received for free  warframe still the greatest game for me after  years of free to play development,27
warframe has been a stable support in my life during good and bad times to keep me sane and away from trouble,26
its great to play with friends and you can spend hours on the game without getting bored,15
the game provides challenging content for the more elite players that have time to waist,-1
the game development has a focus on new player experience which makes it easy to help friends start out,4
dev team is still interactive with community and regular patches and fixes,11
for new players that would like to try the game i say go for it,13
many guides on the internet to view and plenty of videos and players willing to help starting the game of with a friend at your level is a good idea since you can help each other,51
if you have a friend that has played warframe for a long time you are in luck,32
play the game at your own pace and enjoy it,-1
before long you will be a strong player and a great team mate,-1
warframe is amazing and i urge everyone into space ninjas or one man army type stuff to play the game,5
its ight,58
yesindeed thus the lords of farming never tire in their quest of eternal farming for the glorious day where thy dreamed item shall come from the sky above,35
one day,-1
one day,-1
it shall come,16
it is a good game surprisingly for a free to play never expected that but my only gripe with this game it is too grindy that it forces you to upgrade your items for long periods of time,-1
this game is special unlike any other,-1
every update brings more and more ways to just have fun,12
loot system is exciting and after hitting steel path the want for bigger and bigger numbers is so very real,-1
with the most recent update at the time of writing warframe  has seen me engaging with the game more than i ever have,32
the community is so lovely and helpful as well,4
never tired of playing this game,-1
amazing graphics good ai and maintenance which is very impressive for a fp game,10
hope ive convinced you to at least give it a try nothing to miss  nov  still not bored,-1
every warframe you can use is unique,-1
theres a ton of weapons that i havent seen in other mmos and playing with friends is a blast,31
and even if you need to youll probably get discounts in game and this is awesome because customization mostly comes from cash items,8
and customization in warframe is super complete,14
also our true endgame  lastly you have freedom,0
you can build your characters and weapons any way and youll always be able to rearrange and change everything whenever you want,31
most people in the community will be happy to help you,4
the game is better than ever,-1
i played this  years almost nonstop,-1
my bud loves this game and i think it looks cool,23
its okay,58
warframe is like a less glorified destiny  and its also free,27
pros free more variety good graphics events that include the whole community you can fly  game is rewarding  unlike other games you do something like beating captain vor for the first time you get prizes like weapon blueprints and etc  cons tons of glitches  mind you de is still trying to fix all of them grindfest  trying to get parts you need pay to skip  the grindfest gets ahold of you and you just give up eyes hurt  i usually play warframe for longer than  hours a session and there is a lot of neon colors everywhere,47
its always a good time to start playing warframe,32
better than destiny  and free,70
one of the best fpgames youll ever see,10
loved every second of it,16
recommend this game new interesting stuff comes out every update so you have that going,-1
lovely freetoplay game,49
after just a few hours of gameplay which passed very quickly i realised i had found a game i truly enjoyed,-1
the graphics are good the gameplay is varied and intresting coop is good pvp is good and there keeps getting new things added to the game that keeps your intrest peeked,-1
i unlocked almost everything before i left and did sorties good and well,3
from the very moment i entered the tutorial i liked it,51
then after a couple of missions done i said to myself  this year im grinding this game,3
warframe is captivating,26
most importantly  its a free to play massively played multiplayer game,0
graphics are stunning,1
mechanics are fascinating,-1
community well people i was lucky enough to meet already making me say is brilliant friendly and supportive,4
i am in love with this game and i wish more people like me wondered if it will be as good as they say become one of those who say its a piece of the most tastiful cake,-1
cheers lovers,6
peace,34
its good,29
very good,6
posted january  grind is crazy but im here for it,3
im a new player coming from destiny and in my opinion nothing will give me the same dopamine rush from the gun play in destiny but the variety of content and the amount of warframes to acquire is insane and i wish bungie was on this level of innovation because some of the content has actually blown my mind,84
warframe is everything i wish destiny was smh i cry,-1
it gets really good after about  hours,7
edit it gets even better  hours in,76
hopefully itll get good again at  hours,7
awesome game best free to play game evercant stop playing,0
this is the ultimate free to play game for anyone looking for a great rd person shooter,22
pros frequent content updates decent community possible to access most content completely fp has its fun moments  cons can be buggy at times grindy game some unfun game modes early game can suck lack of balance has frustrating moments  overall its a game you sink a lot of time into then forget it for a year just to repeat the proccess,47
if you dont mind the grind its worth a try,3
my son got this game for christmas in  from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing,-1
i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died,16
this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well,-1
this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,63
warframe is basicly a game about spacerobotninjas the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is adictive like heroin,-1
the community is awesome and developers constantly bring up neat ideas to improve the game although alot of times they really get overexcited and rush them out too quickly issues that always get fixed though,-1
this game has lots of elements that reminded me of my fave games like resident evil  shinobi tenchu metal gear solid castlevania sotn dead space mass effect  and omega boost  all at the same time and i love it,5
this game is fun playing solo or with friends,36
i love playing as storm volt,-1
this is one the very few true free to play titles on steam and has the best community ive seen so far from most fp tps games ive tried on steam,0
easily became one of the games i always highly recommended to my friends who have a desktop or laptop pc or ps,15
this was also a good way for them to get introduced to steam,0
fantastic work de,-1
keep it up,-1
i didnt play much but looks like a nice game so far,7
fluent movement using weapons feels satisfying clem theres too much to say and little time this game is amazing,9
a really nice action game and the best free game,0
its free so theres that,30
warframe is in the best shape its possibly ever been,26
if youre looking for a live service game that doesnt try to nickle and dime you at every corner that gives you all the gameplay expansions completely for free and has a community of welcoming and helpful players theres no game that compares to warframe,27
the onboarding experience isnt great but if you can get pass that hump warframe is an incredible game,-1
hopefully this will help others too,4
guess what though it is actually very fun to do that,52
this game makes this grind very good because the actual gameplay is fantastic,3
so yes it is fun,52
,2
yes i admit you may need some help along the way to get some of the things you want to have but honestly im good with that,8
i have hesitated to play this game for a couple of years now but millions of players and many very positive reviews cant all be wrong,40
i would also highly recommend searching for this game on youtube,13
there are many great reviews on this game for both positive and negative points to help you decide,40
it was fun while it lasted the game is still good allbeit less fun when youre at the endgame,-1
better than i ever thought possible for a free gameabsolutely gorgeous in k and smooth as butter well optimized,1
the mix of environments sound design mechanics and gameplay make for a classic masterpiece that continues to get better every month,1
you get to be a cool allpowerful space ninja at the cost of your entire life grinding for things,5
but you still get to be a cool allpowerful space ninja while you are grinding,5
after more than  hours im still clueless about what im doing but im having a blast,-1
this game is a very grindy repetative game but if you love those kind of games this game is for you,3
the community is really helpful with new players,4
this game offers alot of diversity even though its really repetative at times,-1
the gameplay is solid the sound design is fantastic but very grindy as hell,1
the game is pretty cool and its just in beta yet,59
a perfect mix of coop tps and hacknslash and you can get every warframe and weapon for free,60
but i say this the game is very easy to learn and to play,73
i am a kind of person that no minds grinding and this what it is,3
you level up you become badass then you blast through low level stuff like the god you are,-1
and you have various ways to show off how powerful u are,-1
i would recommend this to others its fun its graphics are sharp and when you have people to play with it helps alot too,-1
the game became too much of a grind for me to continue playing but i will say that it is probably the best game of its genre that ive played so far,3
especially since there is no pay to win features as you can get practically everything it offers by just grinding,3
great game great devs cannot compare to any other game i play,11
this is an everexpanding ennemymowing and overall quite well made game,-1
the devs are really close to their community and their freetoplay politic has one of the best economy ive ever seen if not the best,11
it has a compelling story and awesome cosmetics to create pretty fashionframes,1
an amazing game and as a begginer i am very impressed of graphics and gameplay,1
i am yet addicted to unlock all achievments,21
never have been a person for that kind of games but i am already into it,13
i recommend this game with both hands,13
a company that cares about its players i cant,11
you will love it,16
warframe has incredibly imursive gameplay it is free to play and is not pay to win sure you can unlock most things much quicker but everything in the game is accessible without paying except for skins which is really cool,27
the multiple experiance systems really brings a strong dynamic of replayablity and scaling to the game,14
this game is really fun and i highly recommend it of course it might not appeal to everyone cause its really grindy but the core gameplay is extremely enjoyable especially with friends,-1
great game probably my favourite game on steam all things considered,-1
plays great huge variety of missions countless weapons and frames to farm for parts build and use,-1
nothing is ever out of reach though and now that i understand the mechanics a little better theres no real need to spend any money in this game unless you want to,8
i made one major purchase which was the hydroid prime pack which came with more platinum than i thought id ever need,48
im very happy i did this as it gave me more options without taking away from the grind,3
the community is great though and ive never had a questions go unanswered in chat,4
,2
every time i come back to warframe its a little better,-1
i loved the look of the game from the first day keith thompsons art design shows and it is awesome but it was bugridden and sluggish,1
i come back six months later and here is this immersive actionparkour gem packed with gorgeous particle effects and set in an interesting universe,1
come back a month later and the interface is all cool now and they have customizable everythings,39
the latest iteration is almost perfect,12
the eternal king of the free to play category a shining example of how to do it right with a learning curve like a brick wall dont get put off if the game doesnt click right away find a clan get people to help you youll get there in the end,0
lovely fp third person action game with a massive amount of content activities playable characters weapons crafting etc and plenty of things to do,22
extra fun if you get to play it with friends,15
warframe can be a bit overwhelming for new players since it has plenty to offer but the whole learning process feels rewarding,-1
yeah its pretty damn fun,52
unforgettable enjoyment,34
can be very grindy but its a great free to play game and the graphics are amazing fun to play and has an awesome community digital extremes did a fantastic job,3
they still do updates put out more content and listen to the community unlike most developers out there i highly recommend,-1
best game if youre looking to kill time or be creative or kill this with op weapons this is your game,24
some might say this game is easy but thats not the point i feel that my goal in this game would be to unlock all and make my favourite weapons the strongest amongst the playerbase using the riven system,31
definitely worth getting if youre not looking for a competitive game that has nice graphics and is pve,78
de are great developers maybe the best in the world as in they do not just want to grab your money,-1
whole game is free you can get the most expensive cash items by trading in game items for premium currency,8
that out of the way warframe is one of the most breathtaking games i have ever played,19
it is constantly growing and evolving,-1
it has one of the best communities that i have ever had the privilege to be a part of,4
the development team digital extremes pour their hearts and souls into this game and it shows in every single new update,42
this company deserves every cent i throw at them and i hope that this fantastic game keeps going for a long long time,11
keep up the fight tenno,44

early game content was never a problem to begin with now there also is decent late game content,53
i can happily recommend it now,25
the update brought a new quest  new weapons one of them can be considered good and many skins thats it,-1
original review  dont get me wrong the first  hours are fun really fun,-1
the game is very addicting and you will want to play,21

the best game ive played,54
i already have many hours in it and im still fascinated by this production,7
an indie game with aaa graphics and most importantly most customer friendly developer i consider them as par as cd redprojekt,-1
this is the first game i played seriously the game that dragged me into the gaming world,-1
i love warframe with all my heart even tho the things in game seems to be so complicated for me to understand most of the time xd now with a different account im playing the game again and im so happy about it,32
ive been playing warframe from very early on and for many years,32
its amazing how much theyve changed and adapted over time,57
the game has awesome customization and there is almost always something to do,39
while not necessarily for everyone to me warframe is a unique blend with very passionate developers that take pride and love in their game and constantly trying to improve and add to it,-1
the best thing is that for all its features and looks its completely free so give it a try,30
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
me like game yes,28
,2
better than destiny,41
uwu,2
absolutly the best free game ever this and league,0
the developers are very open with the players and listen to our complaints most of the time looking at you universal vacuum,11
the community is one of the best there are im steam and the only one missing is you so come and join us,4
however i finally relented and thought i would give it a try as i am currently between games waiting on a new release,13
super fun,61
its fast and smooth decent graphics  nice controls  its really rather good and i would recommend it to others,1
its a fun and addicting game and is best with friends,15
the devs always try to come with new and exciting content and always listen to their community,11
even in  the game stand strong as one of the best fp out there always fun to play a game made be people who understand what makes a game fun,10
the grind never stops,3
warframe is my most played game on steam right now and i have been playing it for over two years,-1
i have experienced a lot of the updates and all of them bring something to the table,12
i have played nearly all of them and they are all on their own level of diversity,-1
with a wide array of options to choose a frame anyone can play this game the way they would like,14
the guides are players who dedicate themselves to helping new players become more familiar with warframe and what it has to offer,-1
this used to be a drafted group of people but now that applications were accepted it will be expanding greatly,-1
i for one have submitted an application and hope to be accepted,44
me and countless others believe the game is worthwhile enough to help new players like the game for what it offers instead of being turned away by the vast amount of information being thrown at you too quickly to comprehend,-1
if there is any game that has potential for the future even after so much idealistic success it would be warframe,19
warframe is highly addictive,-1
very cool,6
this game is very fun and free although it is mostly just grinding nonstop if you dont play extremely often it is usually fresh again,3
very nice game updated sonstanly and nice gameplay,12
very good game friendly player community constantly updated with new things and hotfixes good controls and awesome graphics for its size and requeriments,4
and the best part is that you are not forced to buy cash to get cash items as you can easily farm them as you play minimum  minutes of farm depending on luck and sell them for ingame cash,8
eventually i got a few missions under my belt and found the color customization screen and from that moment on i was hooked,39
however it really hit home for me after my fourth mission that this really is all about the spectacle and enjoying it,37
this is why i enjoy playing this game,-1
join in and see if you can wallrun with this old man  well it still rocks,-1
a totally new campaign dropped that add tons of new stuff to do,12
product received for free  damn this is a cool game with all the updates they keep doing they are out doing themselves the best part of this game is there is no bad words so it is safe for little ears that hear in the background,17
for a free game to start out with and slowly build yourself up a person can do no wrong with this game it just takes time and patence,0
so come on in and join me in this game and have some fun as well,-1
,2
awesome game,65
pretty good game but the grinding needed to keep up with endgame players is insane,3
de continues to update this game in ways that id never have thought possible when i first started playing the game early in its lifespan,68
this game is too good and is very addictive,21
run when you still have the chance,-1
,2
its okay,58
nova best waifu,-1
for someone who likes a good free to play coop game that allows you to get anything you can get with microtransactions just by playing the game likes fast paced battles shooters with rpg elements lots of weapon and character customisation and a grindy endgame warframe is an excellent game you should consider playing,24
u can eventually one shot bosses with the right build,31
the good incredible graphics and sound design in most places especially for a free game vast variety of completely unique weapons and warframes classes to choose from about  weapons including variants and over  warframes insane amount of content,-1
i have  hours and still have hundreds more hours to do none of which require money great community,4
the odd toxic player but vast majority of players ive met are friendly kind and will help new players for no reward,4
huge amount of quests some of which being some of the best narrative experiences ive ever had in my gaming history with plenty more down the line once you get to it the storyline and lore of warframe is amazing imo its so in depth and interesting with loads more still to emerge,67
overall though the game being free means that it is still worth checking out if you like mmos quests looting good looking games with tonnes of customisation etc etc,-1
graphics and sound gameplay  story  lack of grind  overall  definitley worth checking out,3
i ended up spending lots of money on this game because i like the devs so much that i dont even mind,-1
awesome game,65
met gav the warframe legend,26
good game,45
its a very fun game if you dont take it seriously and have a wiki open,-1
good game,45
the lore is good the gameplay is good but it becomes repetitive when you hit the endgame stages,18
if you like grinding or collecting stuff this might be a good game for you,3
fp done right,10
ea and blizzard could learn a lot from these guys,11
its definitely worth at least a try,20
while the gameplay loop of warframe has remained consistently the same throughout its development cycle the mechanics lore and world building of the game has evolved tremendously,-1
its a fp game of triple a quality and some of the most passionate development teams in the current gaming industry,10
excusing some ingame market new player traps it also has one of the most fair ingame economies and premium currency monetization for a fp game,8
yes,33
i like it,16
it added a romance system so i can at least pretend i have a life while playing,-1
its fun,52
,2
but other than those small naggling bits its a solid game with a good core shoot loot and fight kind of flow and if you decide to delve into the deep of lore and storyyoull have quite the interestingly amazing time,-1
do you like awesome skill shots,-1
,2
probably the best free to play rpg shooter out there has some cheese mechanics that make it a little too easy at times but hell its free you can get everything aside from some cosmetics without paying,0
frames are easy to obtain there is a free battle pass every few months with unique story to go with it,27
i have been playing on and off for some time  the good,-1
,2
,2
grate story,18
your a magical ninja  the bad there is just to much you have to get done at times,5
this game is packed full of endless fun,-1
better than expected,-1
i love the awesome story playthrough and all the different things you can do in the game,18
ninjas play for free  updatedevs are wonderfulthey have the most powerful mods,5
this game has a bunch of different levels and objectives altough it can get a little repetitive it is awesome,-1
but to be honest you have to play it with friends its amazing fun and ill guarantee you that you will play more,15
this is a surprisingly fun and livable game sure it needs effort to be enjoyed countless hours of farming and levelling but it never feels too boring or repetitive,-1
it has a wide variety of playing styles wheter you like to headbutt your way into the action or just lean back and rack up the headshot count and the devs makes sure that everything becomes even more fun the more time passes i give it a full  edit almost  hours later and tons of content i can officialy say that this game is not a  it deserves a,-1
fast paced space ninja actionwhats not to like,5
very fun to play,46
yes,33
cool game but you need a lot of time to get your gear up or pay to get it faster,-1
my life is complete,-1
what it lacks in polish though it makes up for in sheer ambition and content,53
good animation game with big monsters,9
product received for free  genshin impact if it was good,17
destiny  having a higher metacritic score then this game is acc wild,41
a decade has swiftly passed as comming from xbox  and looking back at warframes evolution is remarkable,-1
what started as a unique blend of thirdperson shooter and hack n slash has blossomed into something far greater all without costing a dime,22
warframes combat system with its remarkable freedom of movement and flexibility initially captivated me and has held my attention since,-1
few games can compare to the experience it offers,-1
over the years warframe has amassed a wealth of content providing endless opportunities for exploration questing gear crafting and conquering ever tougher foes,81
take your time savor the sights and appreciate the details,20
alternatively go solo its entirely manageable,36
they may seem straightforward but they hold valuable nuggets of information that will prove beneficial later on,-1
if youre eager to dive into the deep end and experience mid to endgame gear and mechanics choose duviri,-1
my strong recommendation is the former path,25
absolutely love warframe,26
the community is so helpful generous and amazingly friendly,4
there is loads of content and a lot of learning but not overly complicated once you get the hang of things,-1
but it does help immensely to have the help and support of the community when starting out,4
i dont know if i would love this game as much as i do without the community,4
this is a great multiplayer game always fun to play with friends however this is a pretty grindy game so be prepared to spend some time exploring and fighting,-1
the unique graphics makes the game immersive and fun,1
the mechanics can definitely take time to get used to but trust me its worth it once you gain the capability of knowing your special abilities and general quick movements it starts getting really fun,73
this game can be complex but can also be really fun once you spend the time to learn it,73
if you have not tried this game yet i highly recommend getting it especially if you have friends to play with,13
iz gud soup,71
one of the best free game in my opinion,0
it is a very addictive game,21
also the community of this game is amazing,4
product received for free  just wait till you hit the plot your cant stop lots of game time and a really nice community,17
product received for free  its fun i guess,17
i recommend this game because its content is original its gameplay is fun and intuitive its idea is unique,-1
the gunplay is satisfying the parkor is an active element of the game and very fun and the sheer scope of the armory is impressive at the least,9
overall this game holds my heart dear with an even array of love and barbed wired cutting and healing in almost equal measure but a measure so high i cant help but keep coming back regardless,-1
overall i recommend this game because it is free its well made and its fun,-1
yes,33

the best game ever to fulfill every gamers wish on action packed games,56
and yes the game does have microtransactions  it is free to play after all,-1
and to be fair i have spent money on the game  but my motivations were doing so were motivated by gratitude i felt toward the developers for building a solid and fun game for reference i made my first purchase at about  hours in around the time of my birthday,-1
digital extremes truly has their heart in this game and they truly value the opinions of the players this is evident in the community involvement they strive to maintain in order to hear player feedback,42
for people who like the looter shooter genre warframe is good fun,-1
sure it has steep as hell learning curve inadequate ingame explanation lacks in substantial world building but it makes up for this in its incredible movement and combat system  both of which make you feel like an overpowered space ninja god  as well as incredible graphics that handle well on potatos and above all a stellar community,5
if you havent played it id recommend giving it a good try  once you catch on to the gameplay loop it can be pretty good fun,13
and if you have played it and left for a while theres always now to feel like a space ninja god again,5
a great game overall and the developers are still giving us good updates every once in a while,12
its more fun with friends,15
very fun game always love to come on each day to it,-1
i highly recommend it,25
after  hours i can safely say ive done pretty much everything available in this game right now and i will play it even more when new content comes around,7

if you are looking for a game to play between games give warframe a run sometime you may like it,19
the good every weapon and or cosmetic can be earned without spending a dime provided they are not tennogen stuff,8
the community for this game is friendly and you will easily find someone to help you out,4
it is updated every year with new content and continues to grow,12
graphical fidelity has improved a lot since the games start back in,1
if you are a graphical junkie you will like this and know it will keep upgrading its visual look and appeal as it ages,1
tons of warframesweapons quite a selection of companions to choose from too,14
fun with friends and focus on pve,78
interesting scifi fantasy story and lore for those who prefer that and not just gameplay,18
playing a mission and completing it in under  minutes feels rewarding,37
on pc you can receive a discount on your next purchase of platinum ingame currency,48
good when your pockets are crying,-1
i have played this game since closed beta and still find it interesting to get back to it and take it for a spin,59
hopefully this review has given you an insight if this game is for you,40

i am a grand master founder for warframe,-1
they overhauled the whole movement system  they have added in quest mission in to the codex most are really good  they have now added fully open world map sets to play in,-1
warframe is a free to play game done right in my eyes i spend money in the game as i am enjoying my time in the game,27
in nov  i came back from a  year break in warframe after the fortuna update u and wow has the game changed and all for the better,32
i am having a blast in the game,23
i would recommend this game,13
outside that the game still feels the same the people i have played with are for the most part nice and friendly when you ask questions to get caught up  i would and still do recommend this game,-1
warframe is a game that is part of my teenhood and its also the only game id play again and again not for the nostalgia of it but for what the game is currently ive been playing this game from  and im hella sure i wont ever leave this game forever the devs are the besttransparentand actually cares abt the game shoutout to steve for beat a goat the game is always evolving introducing new playstyles and new modes the devs admit to the mistakes they make and try to correct it the community is the best although at times toxic to other games this might be the only game few players can truly call home  we all lift together tenno,-1
not gonna lie this game is a masterpiece and the devs are so nice i recomend it tho at times it might be a litle bit repetitive,-1
pros  alot of content,47
fun and smooth fastpaced movement and gameplay,9
surpisingly a decent story  addictive grind,-1
theres just something about that makes you want to keep coming back,-1

you will spent most of the time going through the same levels i can understand why the grind wouldnt be for everyone but i personally ended up liking it,3
he got alot of help figuring out the game but it still feels like a miracle that he was able to understand all these different mechanics,51
perhaps the game isnt that difficult to get into even then its still worth trying and hey its free,0

this game took my lifetotally worth it,-1
it keeps getting bigger and it keeps developing,-1
you wont regret it,20
hours on the record and still going strong warframe grabs you and never lets you go,32
pros  fastpaced and exciting gameplay with a high level of mobility and acrobatics  wide variety of playable characters each with their own unique abilities and playstyles  deep crafting and modding systems for weapons armor and companions  regular updates and events that add new content and keep the game fresh  strong and supportive community with a wide range of playercreated content   steep learning curve for new players with many systems and mechanics to learn  some repetitive gameplay loops especially in the early game  grinding for resources and new gear can feel overwhelming at times  some players may find the overall aesthetic and tone of the game to be too overthetop or campy,47
fun,61
in my eyes this is by far one of the best games in the internet so far featuring top tier graphics gameplay and story,-1
definitely recommend it to anyone who likes fast paced coop games,24
i cant explain why i love this game its just such a great combination of great game mechanics from even greater developers,-1
i think warframe is one of the best grinding game if you wanna spend alot of time making your charecter just be able to litterly do anything,81

this game is a true gem and speaks to the depths digital extremes can go with their storytelling their game design and quality,42
for a freetoplay game there are an amazing amount of achievable goals and i feel that theyve managed to maintain the integrity,49
the game play the art the lore  i think it speaks to how much the devs care about their creation,-1

story is odd at first but gets good later on and drags you into it with good twists and great cinimatics with a beautiful soundtrack,18
gameplay is fun grindy but you dont really mind the grind to much,3
warframes feel unique and fun to use and weapons do as well,14
this game makes you feel like a total badass being able to wall run while shootng doing flips sliding on ziplines it feels like so much fun,9
this game also caters to every playstle and i guerentee there is a warframe for you out there,-1
meele combat doesnt feel like a stale spam fest it feels like that at the start but once you learn how to use stance cards it feels like something like for honor or a good fighting game the combos feel fluid and look good,9
the wide selection of weapons and frames is great but even grater is the coustemization you can do in this game,14
warframe is an amazing game with fun fast paced action or slow stealthy action if you want,19

another account is made not long after that account and after a while i would say i am doing rather well for myself,-1
this game is actually really addicting if you are into rng and grinding out some missions,-1
the quests getting released every now and then get increasingly interesting,67
especially with the last tennocon things are changing possibly for the better,57
i would definitely recommend this game to a person with a lot of time on their hands at the same time try to find a friend who enjoys this type of game just as much,13
having a friend to play with is definitely a lot more interesting and fun,15
too fun,61
i love this game i sped a year playing it,28
if your answer is yes play it and dont forget the good old grind  k hours after still dont have everything in the game but still playing when new updates drops,3
love it,16
,2
been grinding since started playing still grinding this sheet boi,3
worth the time,20
to see the progress you made all those years it really is kinda worth the time just by admiring your loadouts and that one prop thats stuck in your spaceship forever,-1
product received for free  this game is astonishing for being free,17
the vast amount of content one can do without having to spend a single cent is remarkable,8
the duviri paradox quest is beautiful and ambitious i am so glad they opened it to newer players,67
it gave my friends a chance to see what outstandingly fun content the later stages of warframe holds,-1
the gameplay is smooth and exciting,56
this mobility coupled with the fast gunplay and brutal melee combat is just so satisfying,9
theres a huge variety of mission types to keep this gameplay fresh ranging from stealth sections to full on boss battles,37
this game is fun on its own but with others the experience is far more exciting and chaotic,-1
honestly love this game but beware of scammers,0
i absolutely reccomend this game,-1
if you like space and ninjas spoiler alert there is technically only  ninja based character then this game is for you,5
this is actually lore based so any of you who like lore then this is also for you,18
also you can now explore  new open world levels,38
theyre really fun and i absolutely recommend this game to anyone new to steam or video games,13
this game is honestly the most fun game ive played in a long time,-1
the game is quite balanced and works completely fine in my humble opinion,-1
the amount of grinding in this game is crazy but its worth it once you get away from the begginer phase aka the mr curse you begin to have a completely new look at the game youve finished the star chart and finally learned how relics work youve obtained your first prime and possibly even learned about lua drift mods and the puzzle rooms,3
there is alot this game hides that you cant see and its darn rewarding when you unock those stages of the game,-1
i would love to see him make a comeback one day or a reward for possibly  days played,-1
overall im very happy with the product and ill be looking forward to playing this game again its been a blast writing this review as i get to explain my feelings for this game,40
,2
grinding from the beginning through the end but once you start getting some stuff you just get addicted to it,3
,2
credits are easily obtainable and you will have a huge surplus of them after some time,8
,2
hey if you can read this good,29
no this is a beutiful game that becomes fun with friends,15
even all the lore in this game just makes it good,18
best part the game is basically build how you want to play this game,-1
it has been a while since i posted this revew and this game is still my life,-1
,2
one of the best free to play games on steam,0
ive played alot of games and alot of fp games in general over the years but this is still the best,10
the graphics are amazing the fluidity of the combat actually makes you feel like a magic space ninja and when run with friends,5
its a great experience,69
i heartily recommend it,25
good luck tenno,44
great game never gets oldcause it always gets a bunch of new updates often,12
it is still getting better with each update,12
this game is amazing,23
i was totally wrong its deeper than most games out there and ive already put more hours into it than most games and its still fun to play,-1
the updates make it even better,12
great game to play with friends and to spend time to farm doesnt have to be pay  win,-1
this game is a very good game,23
great job,6
keep it up,-1
,2
its pretty good play it,29
have a awesome event and lot of fun and warframe is a good game,19
warframe i havent been playing it for that long only h at the time of this review but i must say that i am hooked to it so badly,-1
so matchmaking pls and being able to switch teams would be lovely,-1
not paywin even though most people think so warframe is not a paywin game everything is obtainable if you play the game imagine that actually get things for playing the game no paywalls or anything wow,27
,2
awesome graphics on lowend pcs warframe runs really well on low end systems it looks really good but reguires hardly any hardware to run it well thats what i have experienced,1
the dev team awesome devs who care about the game and keep it balanced excluding pvp thats my opinion at least they add new content to the game all the time,11
,2
its pretty k,72
yes,33
this game is too addicting,21
warframes a nice game with coop farming grinding,60
thumbs up oob,6
i love the game its awesomeness,23
the best game everrrr,64
i think i like it,16
very good coop game pretty good looking and the micro transactions are quite nice,24
dis game makes me go fast,-1
for a free game this has loads of content and a wide array of things to do,0
havent played much but seems like a good game,7
ninjas in space with guns dogs and cats best game ever,5
awessssssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooome game i do recommend it,13
digital extremes has made an enjoyable engrossing spectacular game,42
especially when you find yourself a team or  even better  invite some friends,15
its a great game if you want to forget something,-1
edit its still a great game if you want to forget something,76
here you can find many interesting things suck as different weapons,31
this is that i like so much,16
this thing add to the game more interest,-1
it is cool game,-1
cool xd,6
this game was so fun i farted,-1
many hours of awesome action,7
this is a great shooting scifi gamereally i think most players who love space games then this is  to play like anyother,22
awesome action game,65
hell lot of fun to play with friends d,15
its so good now u can have your pet dog,29
,2
fun enjoyable and coop is needed,24
a true tenno will eventually master teh shadows and also the light,44
this over all a great game,23
you can earn all the platinum you need fairly easily this way,48
riven mods could be more interesting and my opinion of this game bounces back and forth fairly commonly but playing this is far more fun with people you like,78
at the absolute end of the day the effort that de puts in and all the time they spend getting stuff right has me respecting this game,68
also the story is well executed and came at the perfect time in play and no matter how annoyed i might get ill remember the events of this game for the rest of my life,18
easily one of the best fp games out there,10
started playing about  years ago and the hours just keep rolling,7
it might be hard for new players to get into the game but the community in warframe is one of the most helpful and friendly communities ive seen in games so you can ask players in the region chat for help at any time,-1
also the warframe wiki is always your best friend when playing this game,-1
its kind of a first of its kind in terms of what it does with only perhaps games like phantasy star online  and monster hunter sharing close similarities,-1
the game has arpg elements in how you farm and progressively work on improving your builds with a truly large spectrum of mods for both your warframe your companion and your weapons,14
i really like this system because most of the customization and personalization is moved onto mods as opposed to having to hope you will get a random drop of a weapon you really want with the perfect stats like you do in diablo,31
you can make real money currency by selling mods or rare blueprints for weapons which for those of you that enjoy that type of gameplay youre in for a treat,83
but i think that a lot of that you will discover yourself,-1
for now if you feel like being a space ninja in an instanced  person coop mission format yet at the same time a game world with a rich economy and very social playerbase try out warframe,5
you wont regret it,20
edit they just added their nd open world environment which takes place on venus and its about x bigger than the one from last year not to mention that future plans include being able to take off planets and go into open space where you can use all previously crafted systems like archwing to fight against enemy battleships,38
fastpaced high octane space ninja action what more could you want,5
words download now this game is badass you can use guns and blades this game is free and cool so why would you not get this game why the hell are you still reading this go get the game,17
product received for free  this is by far the best free to play game there is,17
no pay to win wonderful community new content which gives you new tasks and additions amazing graphics and controls  the cons i have are too meh to compare with those pros so get the game already,47
warframe is really freaking fun,-1
gameplay is fast and slick and your warframe is very responsive,-1
the core game is a huge amount of hackyslashy fun especially with friends,36
you can spend real world money if you like but its genuinely fun to run the same mission a couple of times because the action is pretty intense and the levels are randomly generated so surprises do happen,37
play warframe its very enjoyable and its free,27
what more could you want,-1
yes i highly recommend it,25
the devs really listen to what the people are saying and have taken some huge steps to ensure that our needs are met,11
that being said gameplay is better then ever and the weapon selection is now insanely large,-1
this is a game that takes a bit of getting used to but once youre in youll love it,-1
rushing around doing parkour and shooting bad guys feels good and the abilities of each warframe can feel awesome when used right,14
take the time to learn the game and youll find yourself immersed in one of the best free to play experiences on the pc right now and its only getting better,-1
i can praise the developers who obviously love the game they create and are fast to bring us the new stuff,11
i can say that warframe is the first game that attracted me with its unique style,26
but the thing that i love the most is the setting lore  well its scattered parts which are brought with every new update,18
the lore is by far the most original thing in the game how about a well mixed coctail made of space adventures roman and japanese culture,18
i love it,16
,2
warframe really is a game like no other a shining unique paradigm of excellence that will surely define gaming for generations,-1
the mobility and the fast pace of the combat offers an astounding freedom of movement that really needs to be experienced to be properly described,9
the graphics are gorgeous and the game is relatively bug free with only occasional mostly minor issues,-1
the game is also very efficient so if you have a low end laptop warframe will probably run without issues regardless of what you own,1
recent additions to the game however have included cinematic quests which have proven that warframe is as interested in becoming as deep and lorerich as it is fun to grind,-1
the developers of this game are nothing short of the best most dedicated group of people i have ever had the pleasure of seeing,11
their primary motivation seems to simply be to ensure that warframe their masterpiece is nothing short of the best creation it can possibly be and they seem to revel in beating the ever increasing expectations their players have for the game,-1
warframe is a well oiled machine at all times period,26
and of course the community for warframe is nothing short of astonishing,66
mature positive people abound in warframe,66
i dont know what it is about warframe but the nicest people in the world seem to play it,66
and of course to address the elephant in the room warframe employs the most player friendly business model in the world,66
everything in the game i repeat everything can be obtained without spending a cent short of some strictly cosmetic items,8
warframe somehow manages to feature everything gamers of this era crave while avoiding all the pitfalls and traps so many other games fall into wittingly or otherwise,66
warframe is original and thrilling but also deep and engaging,26
as i go into my fifth year playing this game i realize now more than ever warframe is not simply a game it is a journey one that i will treasure for years to come,32
it needs to be experienced to be understood and it will not disappoint,69
first person game like this not bad to play with your friends or even your girlfriend aint gonna hurt if you try this have fun with it,15
i usually enjoy writing long and indepth reviews for games specially for games i enjoy with a burning passion,40
you may as well give it a go since its free,30
is the best game for ever,64
and cool,16
,2
but as you go on you discover a very well hidden gem,-1

all the unlockables are interesting and keep you wating to play more and more to get the best ones for your warframe and weapons,14
an impressive fp game that includes squad coop leftdead payday the heist a set of combat moves and wallrunning fear but better a fun and not so grindy progression system blueprints materials modcards  customisable builds and once you get good enough its pure sex watching your team demolish a room full of enemies all without even touching the ground d,10

if you like edging youll love this game,28
want a cool new tool,-1
great,6
well i hope youre also willing to wait  hours for that sweet dopamine,7
but that said the dopamine you get is worth it most of the time,20
the combat is fast and flowing and once you get out of the early game the weapons are punchy and satisfying,9
im sure ill eventually get bored of farming for more stuff to farm with but until then its a really fun good looking game with a unique setting and fun characters and a surprising amount of story,35
great game that youll spend lots of hours in if you get hooked at the start,-1
for free you cannot go wrong,0
at first i thought it was just another space game boyyyyy was i wrong this game is super awesome,-1
best skateboarding game of,64
the hyper action space ninja grindfest that just keeps on giving,5
pros of warframe fun fluid gameplay large arsenal of weapons and frames to use good graphics on decent settings  cons of warframe large arsenal of weapons every weapon and frame requires tons of grinding and farming resources pay to rush everything mediocre tutorial  overall ive come to love this game and it quickly became one of my favourite games of all time,-1
my recommendation is to join up with a friend seasoned player or not as it greatly makes the experience a lot more fun,15
limbo is a good frame and deserves better,-1
warframe updates galore,55
edit  warframe has a lot of nice people because they know the pain of learning the game,66
that is the real beauty of this game,-1
i love this game to death,28
my long time favorite game,-1
there is so much content really well hidden from new players which is a bit sad but once you get there it it is worth it,-1
fp model has been improved and especially frames are now a lot easier to obtain drop rates are good and there are a lot events that give you plenty of ingame credits,10
gameplay is solid and is improved constantly and there are updates pretty much every week,12

this game is awesome my advice to you would be not to judge it only by your first experience play it for a while get good gear and you will enjoy it for a long time to come,-1
i have over  hours and they have all been worth it,20
warframe is an outstanding game that has completely won me over,19
from the moment i stepped into its immersive world i was blown away by the stunning visuals and the rich futuristic universe it presents,1
the attention to detail in the environments and character design is simply remarkable,1
the gameplay itself is nothing short of phenomenal,56
the fastpaced action fluid movement and acrobatic combat mechanics make every mission a thrilling and exhilarating experience,9
whether im slicing through enemies as a nimble ninja or unleashing devastating powers as a powerful space wizard every moment feels empowering and satisfying,5
one of the standout features of warframe is the depth of customization it offers,14
the extensive array of warframes weapons and mods allows for endless combinations ensuring that every player can tailor their playstyle to perfection,14
the constant updates and additions by the developers keep the game fresh and exciting always giving me something new to explore and master,12
another aspect i truly appreciate is the supportive and welcoming community,4
whether its teaming up for coop missions or seeking advice players are always ready to lend a helping hand,24
this sense of camaraderie adds a whole new layer of enjoyment to the game,1
warframe truly sets the standard for freetoplay games providing an incredible amount of content without sacrificing quality,79
its mix of intense action deep customization and the everevolving world keeps me coming back for more,-1
i can confidently say that warframe is one of the best gaming experiences ive ever had and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an epic scifi adventure in the vastness of space,19
you can check out the gameplays and its so gooood that you feel like playing it with friends or perhaps solo,36
one thing i liked about this game is  though you can pay to purchase some stuff but you dont really have to payjust grind enough and you get what you wanted,3
but yea keep grinding,3

one of the best shooter looters of all time,-1
,2
best thing about this game is that there is so much content that you will never run out of things to do,53
my son got this game for christmas in  from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing,-1
i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died,16
this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well,-1
this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,63
this is easily my most played game of the past decade,-1
it evolved from a simple rd person shooter to something so incredibly diverse and expansive that i can only recommend this game to anyone that is interested in rd person shooters,22
the gameplay is super smooth and the monetisation is more than fair,8
you can literally do everything in the game for free,0
i did spend a fair amount of money on this game but considering my playtime i definitely say it is money well spent,-1
a game that has more content that a lot of  euro games,53
highly recommended,25
probably the best free game available,0
seems pretty good so far need a few more hours to make a final decision,7
one of the best free to play games out there,0
i think this game is wonderful the story never ceases to amaze me and the new open world is beautiful,23
this is the most fun i had by not leaving the house  in a long time and still keeps me entertained,-1

the game can be abit grindy buts its really really fun,3
the animations are really cool the attacks and skills are dope,-1
really enjoyable game,-1
yes,33
never realised how addictive this game can get especially if you have friends to play with,21
the combat and variaty of weapons is probably my favourite part of the game and the customisation is pretty impressive too with the weapon modding,31
the best free to play game ever,0
,2
good game if you had friend to play with,15
you can get anything in this game for free you just need time,8
great game love the growing community and updates frequently will get boring if you dont know what your doing and specially without a squad,-1
rly fun game and its free,0
rly nice sleek aesthetic oh my god the aesthetic rocks my world,1
gameplay is great its fun to bullet jump everywhere,9
cool story and characters,18
truly the best free to play coop game available,0
its not bad at all if you have a lot of time to spare,7
i liked how you could do coop with friends and how you were able to customize your tenno,24
plus in the gameplay is pretty cool too,56
free to play good graphics good gameplay    what more can you ask for,0
one of the best games i have ever played and no pay to win you can gain anything there is in the market just play void missions and sell prime parts,8
super addicting can not get enough of it,21
highly recommend,25
good game,45
it is a combination of third person shooting fun melee combat deeperthanusual rpg elements lots of customization and a wealth of maps to explore,22
it still has some rough patches here and there but overall a solid fp game,10
i could spend both our time describing the pros and cons of this game  or i could say this  get it and enjoy an experience unlike any you probably or i have seen in a long time,-1
warframe is a good game,19
almost perfect trade system good battle system perfect graphics,1
,2
,2
,2
,2
it improves when you getting new better items,-1
in all warframe is very good game,19
i recommend it for people who like action and rpg games,-1
pew i like lots of pew pew,16
i like this game you can grind without grind,3
best free game yet,0
at first i thought that this game would require me to use real money to make it worthwhilebut the more ive playedthe more i realise that we dont need to spend any money at all to have fun in this gamei recommend this to everyone who wants to have fun without spending any money,8
really good game worth the time for the beginners i enjoyed this game for around three weeks before getting bored of it,-1
this game means the world to me,-1
it has helped me through many hard times and has helped me find and build relationships with many people,-1
it has a unique and highly indepth customization system and stunning gameplay,-1
this is were warframe and de as developers shine in striving to innovate and improve the experience,-1
des dedication to the fans never ceases to amaze me and they actively care about their game and players always trying to do whats best for both even if they sometimes fall short of the mark,68
my personal recommendation is to enjoy this game for what it is and what it tries to be for its players and to not ignore its flaws but understand them for what they are and not let them undermine the wonderfully and lovingly crafted thing this game is,-1
but i gotta say i love it,16
warframe is a scifi action game that gets the rating awesome right at the very beginning of the game youre a freakin space ninja,-1
and a pretty damn mighty one,-1
its coop so youre going to be able to slash through dozens of enemies with your friends which is pretty great due to the fact that there arent that many coops game out there,24
so lets just look at some pros and cons  pros absolutely epic graphics  i find myself quite often just standing around and enjoying the great visuals  great programming concerning perfomance you are able to run the game in high details with just a mediocre setup  exciting fastpaced coop gameplay  a whole lot of content several planets with different mission types tons of weapons and warframes extra missions which you can accsess by crafting keys  you are able to join and form clans and build clan dojos,47
this is a point id really like to highlight because the dojos are such a cool feature,75
basically you can build all kind of different rooms in your dojo including labs duel rooms obstacle courses absolutely beautiful decorations rooms with japanese theming an awesome planetarium and other stuff,75
great fluid gamefeel you can perform several moves like wallrunning dashing backflipping and basically everything youd like to do as a space ninja,5
completely fair fp concept almost everything in the game can be accomplished without spending real money excluding additional itemslots that are quite cheap cosmetical items and items to supercharge your weapons and warframes,8
the developers are great guys who really give you the feeling that they care about their game,11
warframe got so many details and features that the game itself wouldnt necessarily need but just make it better and more thought out,-1
for me personally its not a big deal since grinding in warframe is freakin fun thanks to its action packed gameplay,-1
heres your tldr warframe can be a really great game that is full of action tons of content and give you the feeling that the devs care about us players,-1
awesomely good game for free to play awesome active devs lots of fixes and big updates allmost every month,-1
beats many nonftp games  play it,0
edit  years later d wow  so the developer team has not let down their word of updating the game it is massive plus for the game and should inspire other devs to take similiar actions when making game not everything is perferct some things are are behind massive grind and littlle bit of rng but for someone who has done allmost everything and after so many hours of spending time in the warframe universe its kind of okay its really not the end that defines the game but the jorney and for me the jorney so far has been fun,-1
and thanks to active devs the jorney continues,11
lots of items to craft and earn whilst you can play it completely free or pay to progress faster  very fun game if you like to be a space ninja,5
with advanced sliding phisics over  melee weapons and hundreds of bullets at your disposal this game is really a revolution in dungeon crawling,9
i would highly recommend this game to all players of literally any type of game because if you dont like space ninjas you probably dont like life,5
great game,50
awesome game,65
nice graphic new featured brings more fun,1
best free  play game ever i highly recomend if you dont have money,0
good,74
this is possibly one of my favourite games ive ever played on pc,54
overall i would recommend this game to anybody as long as they are willing to get past the slow start,13
maybe it is the fact you get to unlock cool weapons or characters if you keep playing,-1
you cant go wrong for a free to play game,0
this is the best scify game i have ever seen the graphics are awsome i really recomend it and its free,1
it just take  gbs but is still awsome i dont think anybody could give a negative to this game you should get it now,-1
its a good time if you know what youre getting yourself into,-1
this game is extremely grindy but i certainly dont mind because the core gameplay is solid and enjoyable albeit with a few snags here and there,3
most importantly every warframe and every weapon can be acquired without spending a cent,-1
its a pretty good game  but gets a bit repetitive and the level designs of the first two worlds seem to be quite similar,-1
the ninja movement is quite fun to experiment with  as their isnt really any tutorial to tell you each individual jump,5
either way this is a good game to play with others or even on your own,36
i recommend this game to anyone whos into ninja mechanics and tps,5
yeah its pretty decent kinda hard to get into at first,-1
very fun with friends,15
my favourite aspect of this game would be the art direction and digital extremes actually listening to their players which makes for a very healthy and friendly community,42
give it a go if you havent already,30
surprisingly good for a coop shooter,24
bring three friends blast it up,15
i have thousands of hours into it and play it daily,7
i hope thats a good enough evaluation of how much i enjoy this game,-1
still nice,6
still nice,6
its great it gets better with time   edit its an alright game i kind of like it,7

best game with space ninjas,5
but for real weapons are diverse characters can be vastly different and it stays fun late game,31
this game improves all the time,-1
probably one of the best free to play games ever made,0
but the amount of characters builds and weapons mixed with quick and fluid game sessions make this game fun above all else,31
warframe is my most played game on steam and remains in the top  most played on steam with good reason,-1
i have been playing this game off and on since,-1
there has been a tremendous change since some good some bad,57
so ill try to give my unbiased opinion even though i am a total fan boy,-1
i will also try my best to simplify everything so if you have questions i am more than happy to reply,51
review time  for the fresh new player it is super fun for the first few missions,40

so if you are really willing to learn the game it isnt impossible,73
ive made life long friends on this game,15
i wouldnt trade any of it for the world,83
it is so easy to meet new people,4
its an awesome community of people that live and breathe warframe,-1
the content is there you can find yourself invested into hours upon hours of gameplay,7
but the thing that really keeps you going is your friends,15
its awesome,6
long story longer  get the game try it out talk to some people and just enjoy yourself,-1
its worth a download,20
im always playing and willing to help out any new player i can,4
i hope this was helpful and i hope to see you here,4
free to play done right,0
,2
it grindy it good  your welcome,3
an average farmer at international standereds farms less than a average player in this game also youre a space ninja so its worth it d,35
you can tell a lot of love has gone into the making of this game and i love it too,63
a game that is quickly becoming my most played game in general warframe is an enthralling experience,-1
it constantly keeps you beguiled with exhilarating fast paced combat that never misses a beat,9
the tight and extremely responsive controls give you absolute control of your space ninja,5
enjoy customization perfection with dozens of color palettes different armour and weapon variation and different powerup modifications allow you to spice up gameplay with your personal input,39
on the surface warframe seems like a paytowin game but i assure you it is extremely easy to carve your own path through the game without spending a single cent,-1
highly recommended,25
amazing game,-1
dont know how its free if you have patience and love to farm this is a great game to try out,0
honestly a really fun game i enjoy every minute of it,-1
although it can get repetative i love the community and all the friends ive made which make it that much more worthwhile to play,4
its good,29
best free game out there,0
whats more awesome than being a space ninja,5
very fun game,46
game is veary fast paced with a lot of shiny abilities,9
i recommend this game for people with a liitle more time if you are not prepared to pay for in game stuff,-1
overall very good game,-1
great game,50

just remember that modding your equipment in the arsenal is key to getting stronger,31
the community is on average very helpful,4
its like any other game but its actually fun,-1
fun game with a wide variety of warframes with different abilities and playstyles,14
love this game,28
if i could play this in my dreams i would,13
,2
what more could one want,-1
addictive game with very vast customization system,21
thank you kanye very cool,6
one of the best games ive ever played thats kept me coming back for years,-1
and its completely free,30
,2
warframe may seem like a massive game in which you could spend days into it to grind some gear and loot resources to craft better gear,81
it offers lots to do lots to grind and it may ask you to do redo and reredo  a lot of missions to acquire what you want,3
here are some of the things you can expect from the game a style that is yet to be rivaled scifi has been done and redone in video games but combining the aspects of ninjas space etc in such a stable blend is worth many praises,5
the game is beautiful and surprisingly low to mid tier computers can run it at lower graphics while keeping a good enough visual,1
a good computer could run it in high graphics which truly makes it more enjoyable especially when throwing yourself in the fray guns blazing and blades slicing,1
nearly endless possibilities the game offers you few weapons and choices to start with but as you make progress you will uncover more weapons and warframes to play with,-1
a community worth the detour in all my years i have never seen a community this tight,4
you obviously have bad apples but i made many friends there and many players are keen on helping others,4
the market community would also be a great opportunity for you to acquire some good trades the premium currency is a tradable ressource meaning that you could sell the rare parts you loot but dont need against this currency,83
it also comes with the style many of the cosmetics may be locked behind premium currency but taking part of events trading or spending a bit of cash game sometimes offer you a discount making the purchase worthwhile in my opinion could unlock you some options to make your warframe truly yours,-1
expanding non stop the game is supported by one of the best dev teams the world has known,-1
devstreams player feedback community created content the game keeps expanding with every single hotfix making sure the game runs well for everyone new weapons quests events from start to endgame you will most definitely dicover new things alongside other players,11
media done right the game has taken many players by surprise with visuals but also music story,1
cinematic quests made an entry with a shaking story and outstanding reveal in the lore,67
art direction is outstanding and the community takes part in it as well,1
if you want a tldr here is one that could sum it up its a free game that offers you everything gameplay related for free if you put in the time to grind it,0
i love warframe i play it all the time,-1
i would just like to thank the creators of warframe and those who put time into making this game what it is,-1
,2
better than destiny,41
seems good,6
hours later its still good wtf,7
just download the game already you wont regret it,20
awesome,6
great gamplay epic story bautiful artwork justepic some grindingtolerable hacknslash or shootor explosionsor arrows fireballs lightning bolts sonic attacks orsoul punches you can also settle for invading the enemies minds and making them kill each other so many weaponsnot kidding can fit most playstyles as far as i know space ninjas cmon guys space ninjas,5
plenty of lore bobble heads i absolutely recomend this game,18
not only is there plenty to explore and try out there is still new weapons and gear being added,-1
is pretty good,29

sweet space ninja madness for all,5
out of  in my list of requirements for a awesome game,-1
year later still my favorite game and would recoment to everyone,-1

since then ive made all i ever needed by selling items ingame,8
great market just gotta keep up with prices,83
considering this game is so vast and expansive and frequently updated the way it is,-1
i would have to say its probably the best game you could ever play for free,0
try it love it live it and you will never quit it d,20
warframe is a great freetoplay experience that respects you enough to understand its wide variety of systems without bogging down the experience with overly long introductions or explanations,79
for those who enjoy the experience of working long and hard towards a goal improving yourself and shooting things while jumping around like a lunatic this game is for you,9
warframe requires quite a bit of time to get into but its a lot of fun once you have,-1
this ggame is amazing,23
yes,33
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
this game just gets better everyday,-1
i must congratulate the devs because every time i launch this theres always some great new content for everyone to enjoy,11
and of course its free to play so check it out,0
im sure you wont be disappointed,20
best fp game ive ever played,10
warframe is one of the best fp games you can get your hands on,82
full of content and great gameplay,53
alot of grind alot of fun amazing graphics and sounds great coop,24
superb open world part of the game,23
but rewarding as you progress to higher ranks,-1
game works on very old pc and thats a big plus,1
game is free so i highly recommend,0
i still recommend this game,13
enjoyed the game but bring friends hard to solo but there are plenty of people to join up with if you want to go public,36
nice graphics some coool environments and lots of ways to collect and build equipment,1
i like that you can be competitive without spending cash but found it hard not tolol i had some controller issues when i started playing some mine some theirs but its working great now,-1
i would definatey recommend this game,13
you can acquire anything in the game without paying a single penny if you put enough effort into it,8
fun movement system   beautiful graphics   fashion is a thing,9
nice trade system,-1
endless grindfest,3
while youre at it make sure you take advantage of the wonderful communitymade websites that i will link below   your epitome of the game,4
try the game already its worth a try imrealdawg,13
a very fun game to play  a free to play game that has a great story many different weapons with most of them has a unique effects also with different warframes to choose from  and also prime variants  you can always get the weapons and warframes for free either from a specific quest or farm them from bosses and missions  overall its a great fp game,-1
warframe  is about having slaying and grinding everything in your sight and thats the most enjoyable thing you can do out of many other possibilities that you can do in here,-1
for a fp game the amount of a content you can get is huge and thats the only reason im still coming back to warframe even if i get bored of it,-1
its like those old game you will still comeback to it because its too good to be left behind also you can play with friends which will make your playtime even better especially if you just started to learn the game,-1
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
this game is awesome very time consuming but it worth it,-1
hell yeah haha this game is too fun to be true,-1
well paced game,-1
if you stick with the game past the first couple of planets then you find the game opens up for you significantly by which point you should have a fair grasp of the basics and functions,38
i would recommend this game to people who are used to the diablo style of grinding as well as have a group of friends to play along with,3
with a variety of warframes ranging from sonic abilities to gravitational control the possibilities are limitless,14
making peace to build our future strong united working till we fall,34
making peace to build our future strong united working till we fall,34
just need a budge ofc but the game is good,-1
this game has to be one of the best free to play that i ever played it has a nice graphics and great game story if i could play this the hole time i would do it,0
one of the best games ive ever played,54
can easily spend hours playing,-1
highly reccommended,25
warframe is probably the best freetoplay multiplayer game ive experienced,-1
its not perfect but the game packs insane amounts of content and depth without obvious paywalls provides an enjoyable gameplay loop with more than enough variety and boasts one of the more unique and consistent visual styles in the market,-1
while i never quite fell in love with it warframe provides a really high quality coop experience and id recommend everyone to atleast check it out,60
theres always something to upgrade or strive forwards to and theres enough genredefying optional content like fishing and petbreeding along with single player quests to keep it all interesting for a long time,-1
i personally enjoyed the optional content far more than i probably shouldve such as snapping pictures of rare enemy types but even then i was genuinely impressed of how many interesting designs there are among hundreds of weapons and warframes,14
personally i love this game,28
now of course the devs took the opportunity to put in micro transactions but i have no regrets for any money i have spent on this game because i have had so much fun,-1
was notified i have played this game for  hours i find it appropriate since it is the awful year,-1
i somewhat recommend the game just about everything can be earned for free without paying a dime,-1
its cool,6
decent game,-1
best slide simulator ive ever played,35
when the game is  years old and still updating as well as patches you know you are in good hands also it is the very reason why the game is still alive and kicking  great graphic improvement great stories even singleplayer would still be cool but coop is way much more fun  have a try eventhough you started this game  years late just give it a go game is good regardless how old it is,24
ive been playing this longer than it says here since i was into this before it was even on steam and while i might take hiatuses everynow and then i always come back and its always fun,-1
probably the game i have played the most ever and thats no small accomplishment,-1
just give it a try you just might fall in love like i did,20
what i like  very stylish game nice art style unique aesthetic and you can do a lot of cool stuff like zipping around the level at high speeds spinning through the air as a whirling tornado of blades and death and maxpaynestyle bullet jumps while dualwielding assault rifles  large and ever expanding selection of weapons and abilities to use there is something for everyone here,-1
large potential for optimization and different builds which is certain to please people that like to really get into the numbers game,-1
customization options are quite impressive,39
even without paying for cosmetics you have a good number of options to make your character look the way you want,8
you can change the color of just about everything including your hub area space ship and a good number of cosmetics can be obtained just by playing the game,8
up until now which is just over h in the game has kept me motivated very well,-1
even at this point which is nice,16
while the game can be played solo for the most part it is definitely more enjoyable with a group especially starting midgame when the difficulty begins to ramp up,36
i personally think the freeplay model is well executed and fair keeping most purchases completely optional,0
id rather spend more time playing the game i enjoy then spending a lot of money on a shortcut,-1
that said there are a number of reasonably priced items in the shop that can enhance your game experience quite a bit,8
i enjoy warframe quite a bit and will surely continue to play more of it,32
so turns out i did play more of it quite a lot more in fact,7
fortuna and the orb vallis the surronding area are about  times better than what the plains of eidolon turned out to be in my opinion which is good,38
the area itself is a lot more interesting not just a brown and grey mess and the mission types are less annoying though not by much,37
the community seems to love the new hoverboards but all i can think of is does anybody else still remember when this game was about ninjas,5
that being said it is still a great game and comes highly recommended to everybody that enjoys ninjas fun weapons and making crazy builds to murder fools with,5
a much better game than when it launched,-1
much more content much more polish and a ton of more fun,53
really enjoyable at the moment,-1
there is a big ui update coming out in a couple of weeks,12
if you ask me best game of all time,64
good hunting,45
i loooooove this this is by far one of the best games i have played,54
as a space ninja you will kill zombies aliens and robots all while looking tottaly badass,5
i was in the beta and had alot of fun and will return now that its on steam,59
update  its amazing how far this game has come since  i would still recommend this game to all my friends,-1
im one of the founders in this game and this was one of my favorite pc games since the beginning beta version around,59
it had one of the best and friendliest communities,4
you meet amazing people as you play as i have over the years that i have played this game,-1
but when youre with a great team and chatting it up time flies,15
the graphics are great and sometimes you may even bump into some of the devs in game p  but overall i think its a game that may be fun and amazing for some people but a game that may not be someone elses cup of tea,-1
awesome game,65
still one of the best out there for action and shooting,22
,2
one of the few truly free to play games out there and still out there,0
very wide range of gameplay and story modes integrated and open world environments for play,38
graphics is pretty awesome for a free game out there,-1
warframe is a wonderful game very easy to lose time in this stunning eye candy of a game,19
from custom warframe coloring to skins to mods for custom builds this game has customization options better then any other game ive played,14
definitely worth at least a try  everything can be farmed ingame with grinding hard or you can use plat purchased with real money not needed  dont be that guy who walks past something thats perfect for him and not finding what he wants for years take  hour download the game and give it a try  youll be surprised p,3
epic game too good unspeakable joy i cant go into details,18
i have no idea what im doing but i love this so much,16
pros the core gameplay loop is dope,80
good gunplay despite the third person perspective,22
good lore and story,18
great sound design,1
looks good,6
the community is one of the best of any game,4
good interfaces,1
its satisfying,-1
loads of content,62
totally awesome,6
good game and good graphicstotally recomend,1
best fps tf dota warframe,82
do you like fun,52
warframe is a superb free to play game that you will be able to pump endless hours into,27
i downloaded it and instantly fell in love,16
this is by far the best free to play i have ever experienced,0
spretty good,29
i was fortunate to have an account that i had a bunch of crap on before i went on hiatus,-1
however once you are used to the game youll realize that its worth the effort,13
if you do get to this point i recommend having fun with the game instead of trying to be the most powerful player,-1
there now that weve gotten the standards out of the way warframe is a good game good meaning that it has its pros and its cons,-1
when it comes to pros the graphics quality is amazing for a freetoplay game everything stays moderately difficult and even harder if you play like youre supposed to you know  or  friends all starting at the same time and the parkour system is very smooth and easy to use even for new tps players,47
since the last time i reviewed this game it has changed greatly,-1
latron i love ya baby,16
the best part about this though is that since credits are more easily achievable now ive been able to experiment without fear of losing much,8
of course ive got a favorite nyx i love ya baby,16
but each frame is a refreshing take on the game that renews it completely,-1
i recommend this game provided youve got some friends to play this with,-1
yes veri good i dont do reviews,40
ive been a part of this game for close to three years now and nothing has been more entertaining than warframe is today,32
gud gam,71
there isnt much handholding so youll need to figure out how everything works but youll have a blast doing just that it helps that the community is extremely helpful and friendly,4
warframe has one of the best monetisation schemes ive come across in fp games,-1
highly recommended,25
this game is a great grind,3
after putting a few hours in i can say its a pretty good game,7
perfect for people who like farming and lots of customization,35
awesome gamelove it completley addicted to it,21
awesome gameplay,-1
great game for time pass  lots of fun playing it,-1
,2
still pretty awesome,6
nice graphic,1
excellent character design  excellent environment design  excellent game engine impressive effects all around  good sound design  movement programing is very neat  procedurally generated levels,1
game takes is a bit of a grind to get going but its a fun mob shooter,3
game keeps getting better and better every other month,57
alright this game may be somewhat paytowin but it is very easy to earn your way up the community and be leagues better than those who have paid for platinum,48
i give this game  out of  for the hard work put into it though i experienced a glitch just last night which was fine since it only lasted a couple seconds and the voice acting is beyond what youd expect,7
graphics quality is great for the type of game youre given and you can tell from a consumers point of view that the models are very polished,1
the game play is very nice freeflowing ninjaesque fun,5
stealth is achievable but you can always go with the option of gunsblazing,31
overall the game is a great piece of technology at its finest the community is always willing to help new players since its a challenge to even get good a the game and call yourself an expert tenno,44
if youre having thoughts of downloading this game you really should after all  its free,0
looks good havent played it yet tho,7
its free its one of the best,30
just go for it,20
although a bit complicated and hard to get into at first warframe continues to be one of the best games on pc and considering its free im so shocked how good the game is,27
with a gripping story and plenty of action to keep you coming back with new open world area warframe is a must play,-1
good although it can get repetitive if you dont go out of your way to put variation in which missions or quests you play but there is a huge amount of content so you should be good for a couple of hours or hundreds or thousands,7
one of the highest quality fps out there made with a staggering amount of love,10
its fun,52
i have been playing this game for a long time and i am still and it still get better at each passing time,-1
good,74
really immersive gameplay with a wide variety of warframes to play as and unique play styles,14
i hope they add more openworlds on different planets how cool that would be to be on a waterplanet uranus or other planets like mercury and saturn including the moon or even an open world void,38
idk just tossing these ideas out there but would be amazing to see them honestly,-1
i had a previous review yes i couldve edited it but i wanted a fresh review  plains of eidolon has renewed my want to play this game,-1
after playing warframe for years on ends i can truly say it has only gotten better the development community is active and the game is constantly changing the player community is just as good with there always being more and more events and missions to complete in squads,-1
highly recommend it definitely the best free to play game ive played so far,0
game levels go by very quickly in coop but for a very scary and intense immersive experience i highly recommend just changing the game mode to single player,24
this game is absolutely hands down the best free to play game there is on the market right now,0
the best way i can describe the actual gameplay of this game is a scifi third person shooter rpg gauntlet legends,22
it has rpg character building elements with an arcade feel really making it feel like you can jump in or leave at any time you want to,-1
whats refreshing about this game though is that character levels dont necessarily mean that you cant play with your friends if say youre overleveled or if they are just getting started and this also applies to missions,37
this ultimately makes for a desirable gaming experience unique to rpg games,-1
but most importantly the game doesnt feel incomplete despite it being a free to play game which means that eventually paying money for it doesnt feel like youre spending it on a free to play game,0
as an added bonus the game devs like what they are doing and they all happen to be gamers themselves,11
takes a bit of time to understand but over all a great game,23
plays like it should cost  dollers updaed regularly a game i would recommend to anyone and everyone,0
although i havent played much it seems pretty good so far,7
awesome game always evolving free to play not pay to win,0
yes this is a good game but you have to be willing to lose your sanity and your time if you play,-1
cant wait to play i apoligize for my spelling i have wrote this at  am,-1
okay this is epic,16
a great game to play with friends,15
best parkour game ever,64
i play this game way too much i love it way too much and i have way too much fun playing it,-1
im so glad the developers put so much love into it,11
all i can do is recommending it to everyone that knows what steam is and wants to play a game that has so many great things to it and keeps you playing and entertained with so much new content all the time,0
warframe  install it play it love it,-1
dont think just download it its free  its fun  it has great mechanics and gameplay,0
thats the reason because its called farmframe  edit ok i have a  hours now and i defenetly worth it even if its completely free,0
,2
i cant stop playing this its just so amazing i mean oo its just too good to be fp i heavily recommend it the community is great and its fun to play with friends,10
logged in once seems kinda cool,43
this game is extremely addictive its also extremely free so get it and play it  one of the best things about warframe is its welcoming and helpful community join a clan itll help you out in the long run and dont be scared to watch guides if you get stuck,-1
de is also one of the best companies out there that listen to their fans and update this game very regularly so its not going to die anytime soon d,68
thanks for reading my review and hopefully ill see you out there fellow tenno,44
jokes aside the game is great combat movement community although there has been a lack of updates recently that shouldent be anything to worry about because they are working on a new story quest and a huge ftl like expansion,-1
good game,45
good game warframe b,19
very good storyline,18
good graphics,1
good for begginers,-1
in my opinion it is the best i play the game most of the time and this shows space ninjas rule,5
play the game to find out more and other wounderful content it has like warframestenno weapons sentinals pets dojos remember tenno are ninja your very own ship its insanely awsome,5
pretty fun game to play with friends,15
thanks warframe,26
i have played this game since the day it has came out and personally i think its an amazing coop game,24
the duviri update is goat,-1
love this game,28
although my router wont let me forward ports its still a great game to go solo aswell,36
i enjoy the aspect of gathering materials to build weapons and researching parts,31
i like the aspect of different frames with different abilities and modding capabilities,14
overall great game,-1
honestly one of the most evolving games i have ever come across on pc,-1
,2
keep up digital extremes and the sky is all yours,42
,2
dud dats a gud game,71
great game,50
its pretty unique and lots of fun,-1
this game it actualy pretty good after putting a few hundred hours in to it,7
i actually really like it,16
the design is awsome all the weapons frames and enemies look awsome on top of that it has nice graphics,1
i would recomend this to my friend,25
im not a huge fan of grinding but i still love this game,3
warframe is about space ninjas with godlike powers and the biggest arsenal of weapons the world has ever seen,-1
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
great game worth every hour of investment,-1
honestly my favorite game of all time couldnt recommend it more,-1
the labor of love nominee this year and every year in steam awards,-1
great graphics one of the best dev teams ive encountered to date probably the best fp model ive seen as well,10
if you dont mind a grind and have the time to actually work to obtain your things in this game its definitely worth a look,3
its coop needs some work to actually make missions feel as a team effort as it stands it pretty much run n gun and blow everything up which is pretty great too,24
the constant hotfixes which take place through the week also show their dedication to the current community,-1
just an overall refreshing experience,69
this is a great hacknslash third person shooter action rpg,22
pros  free to play  very decent graphics with good port works fine fps on a notsogood laptop  increasing content  interesting world and story in development  easy to learn fun mechanics  decent helpful community at review date  warframe wiki available with pretty much everything you need to know and even things you dont need to know check cons,47
warframe is for me a must try for everyone who enjoys killing pixels for the sake of watching them explode,26
find or create a clan to get the community experience raid challenge yourself to the leaderboard records with endurance events and have fun in a friendly and grindy environment with this game,75
a great free to play game about space ninjas with awsome weapons with either a pet dog or little robot to help you along the way,5
the game does not require a penny to play of course they add to the fun,8
but you can completely enjoy yourself with out paying,8
its good,29
gotta love the de devs,11
ignore the immature reviews you see here its a good game premium currency can be earned through tradingyou can also buy it to support the devs you decide,-1
if the game doesnt tell you what to do next browse some guidesthere are tons of guides great storytelling it is really worth your time,51
better than no man sky at least you can do anything and see ur friends in the other planet xd lel love this game since the archwing update its been awhile and im going back to this game i miss this game alot,-1
yes,33
the fighting system is just amazing there is no better word to describe it,9
you can do all sorts of crazy parkour movements while shooting down your enemies and trust me every single kill feels incredibly satisfying,9
you can do it,-1
go for it,20
the amount of weaponry available allows you to customize your playstyle as much as you want,39
there are currently over  unique warframes in the game plus the prime warframes which are enhanced more powerful versions of some of them,14
the game visuals are incredible for a game released on,1
its very well optimized so you can run it on any potato with mediumlow settings,1
the thing is the currency required to buy this things platinum is tradeable which means you can get almost every possible item in the game without spending a cent except for the tennogen items wich are made by the community and are bought via steam,48
warframe has one of the best if not the best player base ive seen in all my years of gaming,-1
yes you may find some toxic players here and there but the core and vast majority of the community is highly friendly and helpful,4
in conclussion i highly recommend this game,13
as i said at the beginning its not for everyone but if you can handle the heavy grind you will find a game that will entertain you for quite a long time,3
i hope this review was useful to you in any way,40
oh and welcome to the origin system tenno,44
just enjoy the game you can have everything anyway,8
good games more gameplay variation and stuff then i ever see a game do puzzle  horror  fps  stealth  mechas  skating  space ships story and lores just outstanding but u gotta put the grind and hours to get to it  and ofc the most important thing the butts in this game dayumm,-1
i love grinding grinding on men that is haha,3
iz gud,71
this is definitely well decorated grinding game that can keep rpg gamers occupied,3
i recommend buying this,25
its fine i guess,72
its alright i guess,72
if you like grinding games and amazing gameplay at once this is the game for you,3
warframe may seem hard at first to play but the game only gets more easy the longer you stick with it even offering some of the best ingame weapons for free during events that are more often than you think and special dates like christmaseaster etc,-1
warframe has a massive amount of content to explore including framesweapons and even pets,-1
overall warframe is not for everyone but is lots of fun to play and is updated every wensday with new content and provides lots of enterainment its a must play fp game,82
wow,-1
the movement in this game is what the gaming industry needed,-1

product received for free  good but grindy still kinda feel like i need to play this more,17
very great game love the shoot slash magic controlls i did think the skill trees would be larger though,-1

this game has gotten to beautiful,-1
i had a good run and you were an amazing game i shall remember you fondly,-1
i like this game,28
great game,50
its a grindfest but everything is accessible by just playing the game,3
it will be hard at first but once you start learning and getting better stuff it is seriously awesome,73
,2
this game looked bad years ago but now its one of the best games ive ever played,-1
i mean karson krauss loves this game,28
if you like space ninjas and obsessive grinding youll like warframe,5
also its free,30
to see this game and this developer succeed in a world of shady practices microtransactions and consumer hatred gived me that hope that the video game industry will not crash and burn if developers like digital extremes are more and more common,42
i like to eat,16
just amazing,6
its a good game but there should be a third person mode as well,22
its because i want to give this game the benefit of the doubt and that it probably has improved over time,-1
best game ever,64
warframe is a very fun game of shooting and melee all the way show us some tenno pride,19
plus its free,30
a beautiful game to play with friends,15
one of the best coop games ive ever played,24
pros beautiful graphics and optimization integrated with steam workshop updated often with new content,1
fp done right,10
its still still good,-1
may look intimidating and pay to win at first but with some time and a warm welcome from the community who will help and guide new players most of the items can be earned only cosmetics and community made items need to be paid for,8
the games has great and satisfying combat a variety of warframes with unique abilities strengths and weaknesses allowing for a variety of team compositions,-1
upgrading has great depth to it and seems complex at first but easy to fully understand after a while,-1
fully recommed this game for anyone wanting to find a friendly and helpful commuity alongside a fantastic game that will only continue to recieve more content and future support from the developers,-1
i really liked global agenda so i have a like for this too,37
all in all fun time for free,0
instead of boring you with a wall of text here is a list of what is good and bad about this game  pros  the fun grind yes i said it fun grind  the diversity and unquieness of each warframe  the crafting system  the easy to learn parkour  modding weapons and warframes to make them more powerfull  no pay to win  compalling storyline  the dev team is open minded will be quick to listen and is supportive to the player base,-1
their kind of the mates you never realised arnt your mates  it keeps growing  mostlysupportive community  premium currency is not hidden by a paywall it can be gotten by getting rare or hard to get parts and selling them in the trade chat  cons  long crafting time and i mean like  days to craft some stuff there is stuff to do daily though  rng focus build a shrine and pray cause rng is ruthless use the recruitment chat to get a squad  steep learning curve use the recruitment chat to find help or a guide of the lotus  good luck with the workshop its takes a while for de to process it  plat is key you need to trade like mad get advice and check the warframe market for a good price which is not rediculous  some times things are daunting but do a little research and things become easier  getting into a good clan is hard and remaining is even harder  sometimes it just eats up alot of time if you are busy  heavy relience on premium currency which can be gotten without money as said before  really distracting cause its too damn fun does this even go here,83
anyway i urge anyone who is on the fence or even refusing to play the game to at least get a group of friends together and try this game cause it a alot of fun and even though the grind can get to you when its over you would feel rewarded for your efforts leaving a sence of completion,3

if a game has ninjas like this one then its legit,5
product received for free  no crying in baseball,17
,2
long and very complete game with a lot of history but telled without the gameplay itself multiplayer is good and can be changed to private for singleplayer experience,36
one of the best games out there endless fun the only downside i would say is the content drought between patches,-1
fun game,46
i was introduced to warframe in late  and despite being absent in the game for a few months this is a game ill always come back to,32
the graphics are unbelievable the gameplay is fun the characters are diverse and interesting and the quests are amazing,1
second dream octavias anthem and the war within are among my favorites because of its emotional appeal to the player,63
one sign of great storytelling is getting your audience to be emotionally invested in what youre writing and thats exactly what des writers did to this particular player,-1
the game isnt perfect because of a few mechanics that needs improvement but its surely superb,-1
the devs are also very responsive to the playerbase,11
warframe definitely is a labor of love,26
keep being awesome de,-1
warframe is amazingly addicting,-1
the amount of cosmetic options is absolutely enormous,8
certain weapons and warframes are extremely satisfying to use,14
i think its alright,72

an amazing free to play thirdperson shooter where youre ninjasin space the game is quite simple and might get repetitive but it is constantly updated by the developers and has a nice community,5
this game is a masterpiece and a must play game because its not only free but its awesome too,0
this game is one of the best rd person shooters ive ever seen its fun and enjoyable it has magnificent graphics and its definitely worth it,22
also who wouldnt like to play a freetoplay game which doesnt suck and where you get to play as a space ninja and kill ugly aliens like a badass,5
,2
has its good points and bad  but is very fun to play   all i can say it try it youll like it,-1
this game is very funi had a lot of fun playing this game with my friends but if you really want to get good at the game you need to grind a lot,3
this game is such a good game its free to play and its worth playing it,0
nice quality and sounds,1
cant get enough of this game,-1
it only keeps getting better,57
kinda fun,61
i think i like it,16
fun game i kill bad guys n stuff,46
this game came this far with only fp monetization model,8
its so good to the point that this game is now a standard view of an fp game done right,10
best free to play game ever,0
,2
however some things personal favorites are really fun to do and having a team of friends help you with missions really aids the whole experience for this game,37
its really nice that theres a regular release of ingame events to carry on the evergoing storyline and even more weapons thatmight not be used after youre done using it for a quest and leveling it up to the max,-1
its good,29
ive played a little bit its ok,7
after a few hours and after you learn the ropes its really fun,-1
it has given me around  hours of enjoyment so far and with an active dev team and an awesome play base this is a game you shouldnt pass by,-1
warframe has been one of the most innovative projects of its industry as it was the first product to combine the shouldercamera mechancs together with the integration of the online roleplaying systems and created a world that works both by progressing alone and also in coorperation with other people,-1
but the most important aspect are the operators which are essentialy the users themselves they have very good customization options and also match very well in combination with their warframes there are also various factions syndicates and other types of interactions which attach together very well within the overall narrative,14
uh i really really           like warframe,26
this  player player thirdperson shooter is good for freinds looking for a good time,22
the controls of this game are very fluint and wallrunning and sliding around the map makes you feel like a badass ninja,5
the weapons in this game all have their own feel to them and exploring and testing out which ones are good for you can be very fun,31
the imagery and art style of this game is amazing and beutifal to look at,1
the time when you are surrounded by hundreds of enemies and you pull off your special move to clear them all away is something to admire,9
the best thing about this game is that its free so play to your hearts content,0
be prepared to grind a lot though if you want to be able to get all of the other cool and amazing weapons and warframes without spending any money its going to take many hours,-1
this game is a very strong money pusher but if you stay head strong and just grind you will get to where you dont need to spend a dime on what you want,3
from a scale of  to  i would give this game a  out of,-1
hope this helped,4
detailed butts  cool guns and weapons  detailed butts   highly recommended,31
game fun,46
i followed this game since it came out of beta and i only started playing for real last year,59
the devs work hard to improve it every week,-1
warframe had some uncertain beginnings but it is now one of the only games i play,32
incredible timesink if you allow it to be but very fun,-1
a lot to do the game is visually appealing and the community can be very good if you find the right circle for you,4
if you survive until the th quest things get a lot more interesting and is very much worth the wait,67
yes,33
with warframe being one of my most played games in my libary i think it qualifies as one of the most enticing games i have ever played,19
visually the game can be quite beatiful even stunning at times,1
audiowise the music can vary from unobtusive to bombastic with all being very nice to listen to,1
gamefeel is very pleasant with moment to moment combat movement and just action being extremely satisfying,9
honestly there is too much that i like about warframe that i cannot really quantify it,26
ive played it for a few hours  its alright,7
great game with lots of amazing weapons and warframes,-1
they constantly keep adding new content which is great to see in any mmo,12
they keep adding quality content for free,-1
the graphics still look great,1
the movement mechanics still feel great,9
a cohesive storyline is now fleshed out,18
there simply is no other game on the market that gives me the same feeling as this game,-1
with the frame powers weapons and melee all flowing together seamlessly you just feel so powerful,14
its very cathartic and fun,52
i love the characters and the cool powers but i sometimes feel very overpowered,-1
mobility of the game is extremely fun though and boss fights really feel good to play,9
pvp can be fun sometimes if your opponent is honorable,78
the characters you can choose from at the start are pretty powerful,-1
the game looks really nice its lore is fairly interesting,18
the music is nice and some of the characters have great personality,-1
overall not a bad game,-1

this is one of few games that evolves from player feedback digital extremes listens to their player base they dont necessarily agree with everything but they listen,42
the majority of the comunity is awesome content never ends theres always something you can do still have lots of content ahead after playing for over  years you can do eveything by not spending any money though you wont get tennogen items cosmetics made by fans approved by de into the game,53
a lot of grinding involved however which i guess is the only downside in my opinion but i have to say that for a free to play game it is fun to grind with other players and friends most of the time its not tediously repetitive at all,3
my son got this game for christmas from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing,-1
i asked my son for help and he helped me,4
loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died,16
this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well,-1
this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories thank you,63
product received for free  if u like asia grind and science fiction u may be right here,17
all stuff is free to farm and they keep updating it with new content so u wont run out of fun,0
great job de,-1
probably most robust complex and honest fp title available on steam platform since its release in  up to this point,10
awesome game awesome characters stuning lands nice coop,24
just great,6
with  years of contect an ever expanding list of weapons items and character classes called warframes in this game the options are almost staggering,14
the gameplay is fantastic and visceral and the community surrounding it is welcoming and friendly,4
ive got over  hours into this game and i plan on putting another  hours more,7
sure theres a grind but the act of playing to grind out the items is still a blast to play,3
if youre looking for a new game to play with friends or to simply scratch that rd person action itch free is pretty damn good asking price if you ask me,0
thanks de very based,-1
warframe is a prime example of how freetoplay games can be both financially sustainable and enjoyable,79
the ingame economy is fair and the majority of items can be earned through gameplay reducing the paytowin factor,8
the level of customization available for warframes weapons and other gear is staggering,14
this allows players to finetune their playstyle and appearance adding a personal touch to the gaming experience,39
warframe has a dedicated and passionate player base,66
the community is known for its friendliness and willingness to help new players creating a positive and welcoming environment,4
warframes addictiveness stems from its perfect balance of action exploration and progression,-1
the constant sense of achievement whether through acquiring a new warframe mastering a difficult mission or discovering a hidden lore detail keeps players hooked,-1
the games liveservice model ensures that theres always something to look forward to making it difficult to put down,-1
additionally the cooperative nature of the gameplay fosters a sense of community and shared accomplishments further enhancing the addictive nature of warframe,-1
in conclusion warframe is a stellar example of a freetoplay game that not only delivers on its promises but continually surpasses expectations,79
its vast universe engaging gameplay and commitment to player satisfaction make it a mustplay for anyone seeking an immersive and everevolving gaming experience,56
warframe is a really fun gamethe combat is fast paced and funits a beuitful game and its free,-1
,2
really good game and interesting too for a free to play still need to fix some older bugs instead of keep coming with new modes and history,-1
its uhhh its pretty good sorry i gotta go an alert just popped up for a catalyst,29
always growing and expanding game with loads of content for free,0
great melee and gun combat,9
,2
probably the best free to play game fps of all time,0
its fast pretty and fun,-1
even the micro transactions system is very fair and they keep evolving the game in the right direction with constant updates,-1
highly recommended,25
never mind its great im saying this of my own free will i promise,0
the community has always been a friendly one seeing as of how a veteran player runs out of things to do they usually resort to helping others reach their level,4
its a loop of friendship and only those who stay for the long run will get to experience it,15
with the game updating so often its hard to write a review that talks about what features are best but the constant updates and the fantastic devs and community are reason enough to get into this game,-1
warframe more fun than you can shake a spacekatana at,-1
for those of you scared away from fp games let me say that this game does it as well as it can be done it is absolutley not paywin everything available to paying members is obtainable by non paying,8
iz great yes,6
,2
youll love it,16

the game gets updated often and the lore of the universe just keeps growing,-1
de is doing a great job with this game,68
warframe is one of the greatest mmos to date,-1
it features brilliant graphics as well as game play and is super fun and rewarding,56
it is so in depth with a huge variety of weapons armor and mods,31
it has a friendly community that is always willing to help new players,4
the chat user interface is well designed but at the same time has the perfect little amount of complexity,-1
i could go on all day about the beauty of this game,-1
but i will just conclude that warfarne is a master piece,26
very fun game,46
better than destiny,41
still pretty good,6
better than d good game overall,-1
fun lots o customisation do wot u want,39
this game now takes up most of my time because there is so much to do and it gets better if you play with friends,-1
exceptionally good game im surprised its free,0
truely an above aaa quality game hidden in a fp package,10
warframe is downright amazing,26
the loving devs and friendly community and even better an endless expanding world with every new update make this game thrive and grow unlike any game ive played before it,11
but it is free and for us all to enjoy,30
i love this game,28
there is a quite a bit of grinding involved and a little bit of a learning curve which coming from normal ability bar mmo area took some practice to get used to but the game is full of content and more is added often loaded with beautiful graphics has a wonderful soundtrack and free to play,-1
you can solo or pug but the game is best played with a group of friends,36
at over  hours play i can say that i still love this game,7
correct that  hours this game is amazing,7
good game to fall back on,45
good overall,6
very very good,6
excellent free game for everyone,0
just aim with real weapons    just positive reviewing after such good buffs to people who actually aim and take the time to have fun with the game they love,31
downloaded it  years ago while browsing through fp games almost k hours later i still love it,10
the devs love it and cater for their creation,11
but its a game i strongly recommend to anyone,13
all to become the fanciest danciest technoorganic powerhouse of slaying in the cosmos,-1
i should elaborate on this the game for the most part runs very well and improves wih each update but ocassionally maybe more for some significant bugs appear most notably during large updates introducing new features or systems like plains of eidolon,12
the combat aesthetic developing setting and freedom of movement are glorious,9
this game is truely awesome it is fun map changes,-1
you got action survival spy defense and so many other moods which truely makes the game awesome,-1
very fun in coop with pretty awesome parkour,24
played so long and still dont know what im doing tbh but i love it,-1
this game gets better and better,-1
a good game worth recommending,13
and the market its mixed feelings gameplay good improved even,-1
best thing in this game is meeting other people that will support you trough a grind trough that you will sorta bond with them hell ive met some of my best friends on here,15
this is really the best free to play game in my library no not you dota sorry not sorry you can either get cool stuffs by buying platinum and supporting the devs or grind the hecc out of it and youll still get it for free,0
the system requirements are a bit old now you might wanna have a good cpu and slightly capable gpu to enjoy this game in max settings cause damn it is ducking beautiful my  gb even having a sweat at k but it is optimized for sure cause most of my newbie days i played it on my trusty old sandy bridge laptop with an intel hd lmao,1
oh btw the community is great you there are so many helpful ppl here not to boast im one of them cause sometimes when you get bored you can still have fun by helping newbies or thats just me and i always lure them with my orbiter stuffs to keep on grinding and continue the game,4
now im not a veteran in this game but i will surely be playing this game for more years to come,-1
devs are really cool btw space mom reb is really cool irl,11
the best free game available period,0
hrs on record and dont regret a thing,-1
product received for free  been playing this game since college and all i can say well its very fun,17
wow i cant belive this game is free to playits amazing and so much fun,0
this is so much awsome,16
i mean i played it for a little bit and i can say its pretty cool,7
recommended,25
good game  i highly recommend this game,13
it good,29
pretty good,6
warframe in my opinion is one of the best free to play games there is,27
the game looks beautiful has great mechanics decent ai and a fun questline,1
this game can be played alone but it is much better with friends,36
the developers are very active and always making sure that they can fix any bugs or glitches,-1
i cant do nothing but recommend this game,13
the only advantage you get by paying microtransactions is getting from point a to point b in your progression a little faster,-1
graphics gameplay and customization are just on point,1
this spaceninja themed game is very worth trying for being a fp its movement feels good it has a ton of content although very disjointed and grind that is reasonable and enjoyable to dive into for most gear at the start it also has premium currency you can trade with other players,10
product received for free  decent,17
best mmo spaceninja hero classbased horror drama shooter game ever,-1
if we are having fun while working to get our hands on different ways to annihilate hordes of enemies i dont mind the grind and having some mystery behind game mechanics keeps things interesting,3
enjoyable gameplay is probably the top thing i look for in games,-1
gunplay feels good and has plenty of variety,-1
movement through environments has some skill involved and feels rewarding as you get better at parkouring through massive spaceships and hostile celestial bodies,9
platinum the premium currency is not too hard to get just by playing and trading primed loot with players,48
the community is very good compared to usual cesspools caused by internet anonymity,4
new players can feel welcomed and theres always someone looking to help you figure things out,4
digital extremes the company behind warframe is rather well connected to players and they do listen to feedback,42
for  months now has warframe had me hooked playing nearly every day,32
a great way to spend hours of your life killing enemies to get the materials to kill enemies faster and in different ways if that sort of thing appeals to you,-1
just make sure to use your starting platinum premium currency on additional slots to store weapons or waframes this is one of the only noncosmetic items that needs it and variety is the core of the game so having more right of the bat is a blessing,48
could not recommend this game more,13
one of the best free to play games out there,0
by the time youll get there the devs might actually fix those problem and even if they wont you still had hundreds of hours of quality content  for free,-1
it is good if you like to farm stuff and reading wiki is your passioni feel like the shooting and movement mechanics are not as good as people say but it is okaythe community feels super good as i have never come across a toxic person while i almost always play with random teammates,-1
fine game,50
product received for free  the game is fun to play,17
best game i have played in a while,-1
product received for free  its alright,17
its pretty good i guess,29

this game is epic in so many ways the story is brilliant the gameplay is great missions crafting from weopens to companions to having your own ship i got this game on the xbox one and the pc and i cant stop playing the game i love it and its got a brillaint development team behind it and i think more ppl should give this game ago dont avoid it cause you may think its not a game for you cause you will be suprised when you play it so what ya waiting for come join the many and many tennos playing this game already see ya there on the battlefield,-1
updated well its been a long time since i last reviewed warframe and its amazing how much better the game has become since then,-1

all i can say is that this game is really fun to play either solo or with friends always better with frineds of course,36
on my case i never get bored and collecting all weapons and warframes on the games is like a challenge to me that i have to complete,-1
they keep adding new stuff and biger and better everytime,12

very grindy but enjoyable after achieving a set goal,3
if you think youd enjoy filling your personal space ship with ridiculously cute stuffed animals to keep you company between missions   you should try warframe,-1
warframe is an awesome game well it was until it turned to pay to win kind of games it still kind of is good and the open world update is awesome,-1

i think i can give this a thumbs up,-1
yes,33
product received for free  one of the best free games on steam,17
good,74

,2

now when you want a action mmo thats intense beautiful and unique from a third person perspective this is your answer space ninja enough said xd,-1
one of the best time killers out there,-1
also the best free to play game out there pps,0
also better than a lot of paid games out there,0
the game is just awesome,23
trading is super fast and earning the currency is a breeze once you are on a roll,83
gameplay is fun devs are awesome the community is fantastic and the update cycle is really fast a bit slow right now,-1
youll always be getting stuff and the core gameplay loop is just so good,80
the game has an awesome story too,18
so buckle up and get ready for one heck of a ride,-1
i like this game very much,28
a year ago i turned on this game and i didnt expect how good the game would be,-1
i like the way the game evolves and the game is amazing except for a few mistakes,-1
the game excited me,65
everyone should try it because nothing is missing in this game i think,-1
best game everrrrr,64
few hoursgood gamedont watch any youtube videos and extra guidestry to figure it out alone it is way more fun,-1
best developement team,11
i actually find the bizzare melty design of everything appealing asthetic wise,1
pretty fun game to play to kill some time and have some good old fashioned coop fun,24
the game isnt quite finished yet but i see a lot of good stuff in it already,-1
update its been quite awhile since i last played this game and holy crap its really grown,-1
this game is so much better than it was two years ago,-1
i was blown away when i returned to this game,-1
bravo devs,11
i cant wait to see more from you guys,62
very good game to be free to play,0
great grinding game but for new player hard to understand,3
ive been playing this game since within a month of its release onto steam and seeing it grow into the epic spaceninjahordeshooterfashionshow it is today has been a real treat,57
this game may not be for everyone but if you even have the faintest glimmer of interest give it a try its free,0
the new player experience isnt great but the community is for the most part quite nice and will help you through anything youre stuck on if you ask,4
in my opinion this is the best freetoplay game of all time great graphics and plot very enjoyable gameplay and nice community,49
the best part is that it is not a pay to win and you can get most of the prime goods by playing the game,8
virtually all of the content except cosmetic items or inventory slots can be earned ingame for free if you are patient,8
better yet de has adopted an mmo content strategy with regular updates and new content added almost biweekly making the game fun to return to month after month,-1
very good but very grindy,29
i like this game,28
you should like it too,16
after all the hours ive put in to this game id say it certainly deserves a word or two,7
the game has a lot of polish and a very dedicated developer that is constantly dishing out content,-1
just this past year theyve released two large openworld zones that were huge gamealtering changes,38
the games main story arc is also pretty epic and easily compares to most major titles all while allowing you to enjoy it with your friends,18
the best part is that the game isnt pw,-1
it certainly provides bang for your buck if you decide to go the cash route but you are still able to enjoy the game even if you dont pay a cent,8
an interesting element of the cosmetics though is that some items tennogen are user created and part of the earnings for those sales goes to those users,8
allinall i see warframe as a rare example of a fp done right and their longevity in the market and how active the devs still are is a testament to the support companies can receive if they just do it properly,82
here are the good things about this game when you play warframe,19
,2
,2
you can literally parkour,9
,2
its so cool that companions even have their own weapons and you can mod them to make them as powerful as your character or warframe,-1
,2
the most awesome thing you can have is a freaking katana,5
the katana is called the dragon nikana and its the ultimate weapon for a true ninja,5
so far this is all i can say about this awesome game called warframe that can make you play as a ninja,5
fun yet free,0
best free to play so far in my opinion,0
also always updating and changing to help keep the game feeling fresh and new,12
the best rpg and grinding game i have ever played,3
my favouorite game pretty much of all time yeh its a grind fest but its my grind fest,3
start can be quite dishartening but if ya have a friend who can help or access to wiki you are golden d,-1
one of the best games ive ever got into,54
i highly recommend trying the game out its free,0
what a great price xd its constantly adding new content and ways to play with a great community of helpful players,4
its okay,58
very great game for a free to play,0
good good,74
cool  edit while i think  were its best years and there have been some very rocky updates after that warframe is still very fun and definitely worth playing in,-1
my favorite online game but there is something i have to say about warframe grind fest  warframe  i hope you enjoyed the first time as much you will do at the th time,-1
warframe is the best and i love having a cute pink frame thank you,-1
its a real blast of a game but bear in mind a fair chunk of the progress is grinding and using different weapons before selling them to buy and level different weapons,-1
worth a shot given that the game is free,0
i mean its cool but i need more time with it yknow,-1
ive got  hours on pc over  hours on ps and im still loving this game nuff said,7
definitely my favourite farming simulator by far,35
brilliant freetoplay tps looter shooter,49
constantly reinventing itself with each update in new and exciting ways,12
epic evolving story,18
update is good x,12
best free game ive ever played in my life i highly recommend this for people who enjoy grindy games and love being space ninjas,5
the new content and hard woking devs make it good tho,11
one of the later quests makes this game even more amazing,67
i have spent unbeknownst to me over  hours playing this game and i have nothing but positive things to say,40
as ive learned from the very beginning you could play for hoursuponhours without having to spend a single penny,-1
it wasnt until i was nearing  hours that i realized how much i enjoyed this game,7
not only that but i also thought that investing in platinum for the game would only help make my alreadypleasant experience even better,48
warframe has evolved alot in the small amount of time that ive played it,-1
through player purchases the developers have added new maps new mods a killer melee battling system and outstanding and unique missions and modes that only add to the spontaneity of this game,-1
from my own personal experience its worth checking out  especially if youre a college student like myself and are strapped for spending money on the new games coming out everysooften,-1
give this game a shot and im sure you will come to find at least a few things that make warframe a fun great and unique experience,-1
this is really an awesome game,23
you can say that it is top fp game for now,10
awsome game,-1
this is a great game overall,23
veryy good,6
this game is so great,23
fun with great graphics and space ninjas,5
if you get through the boring beginning of the game youll get to experience one of the best freetoplay games currently available,49
just played for around ten hours straight on the plains of eidolon and this is too good,7
i raced home in the middle of class to play and it was well worth it,7
the plains are massive and have so much stuff and things to do it blows my mind,38
this update is so amazing and large my entire squad spent over an hour ignoring a mission to go fishing,12
and we were screamin laughing and crying our asses off doing that,-1
i have about  hours in this game and would do almost anything to get them back,7
this is a great game,23
product received for free  one of the best free to play games on the on the market without any shady financial practices,17
i have played this game a lot,-1
the second dream deserves the whooooaa award,-1
great fp that u can be better than another just playing  without barriers like another games that if u use cash u could be a god,10
great graphics and sounds  fast commands  nice customization  great variety of weapons,-1
ive played since the beta and the bugs almost dont exist anymore  each update with news and fix for the game that make it fantastic,-1
the most perfect fp ever,10
warframe is a third person shooter that is easy to pick up and rewards players who put time and effort into the game,-1
missions can seem repetitive at times but the constant addition of new content and game mechanics make warframe always feel fresh,-1
these issues however hardly detract from the game itself and are only noticible because the rest of the game feels so polished,-1
overall warframe is a genuinely good game that has a lot of things going for it,19
i look forward to the developers live release and whatever additional changes accompany it,12
s good,74
this is the worlds best free to play game,0
edit  still the best free to play game ever,76
easily one of the best free to play games to ever exist,0
de have done a wonderful job with warframe,26
probably the best fp game outthere,10
i could go on and on and i can never get enough of this game,-1
this is the best freetoplay game i have ever played bar none,49
the art style is utterly unique the character designs are gorgeous andmost vitallythe combat feels fastpaced easy to grasp and tremendously satisfying,1
warframe is a bit of a slow burn game but the new player experience has only improved over the years since its initial launch,-1
i would recommend this game to everyone especially fans of the lootershooter genre,-1
wish diablo was actually fun,-1
the games community is fantastic and very helpful,4
this isnt rocket science its just a diablo path of exile grim dawn style rdperson scifi lootershooter with buttery smooth game play  and i cant praise just how well this game plays its a miracle of fun engaging game play,22
the guns feel amazing jumping and parkouring all over the map makes you feel like a super hero and the combat is fast paced with a ton of different game modes,9
the game can be played totally free without having to spend a dime and there are no pay to win elements in the game,-1
warframe is an incredibly fun game with a ton of content,-1
and i mean its got a ton of content its absurd how much you can do in this game,53
there are huge open world areas theres fishing theres archwing missions which are like arcadestyle d flying games and theres a ton more too,38
and the game is really good if youre an older gamer like me who just doesnt have a ton of time to game everyday,-1
but this game deserves your attention,-1
warframe is ridiculously fun like accidentally stay up till am because youre having too much fun shooting aliens and jumping around cool spaceships and space stations,-1
seriously check this game out and give it a chance its fricken brilliant,-1
theres absoulutely sometehing to be said about warframes ability to continue to be interesting and fun despite the repeetition of some missions,-1
the gameplay is fast and intense and the matchmaking is solid enough to allow seamless cooperative play with friends or strangers,36
the game is free to play so id recommend it if you want to see how a truely fair fp business model works,8
very cool game lots of different weaponsso much stuff to do and farm for,35
the key difference however is that one of them is free and slightly better in every way,-1
now im glad they did,-1
its fun and i would like to say it a good game if you are willing to grind,3
incredibly fun best power fantasy game ive played currently,-1
update yep still the best power fantasy game ive played,-1
this game can be intese at moments like when  enemies spawn ten feet form you but i reaal enjoy the fulide movement,9
also it is very fun to parkor,9
this game is a blast,23
not only does it look gorgeous but because the game focuses on martial arts as a core mechanic and ethos the movement and combat are exceptionally smooth and satisfying,1
the different warframesspecialized suits of war worn by the tennoare all distinct and beautifully crafted with even more opportunity for customization through dyes and various cosmetics,-1
the weapons are unique and satisfying to play with even better when theyre modded and the different skills and abilities all lend new tactical possibilities to the missions,31
a really cool game for heavy machines and even normal ones,-1
very fun game with great movement abilities,9
very addicting,21
this is a fun game especially with friends,15
the business model is fair and while i havent paid a penny up until now i can see myself buying some platinum down the line in order to support the developer,48
there is a steep learning curve but if you persevere and start learning it is quite rewarding,-1
pros nice graphics tons of weps tons of characters different playstyles from each character different mission types awesome cinematics constantly having new cool updates added regularly not pay to win  cons hmmm cant find any tbh,47
one of the best free games out there,0
it may be super grindy but it is super fun being a space ninja,5
gud,71
its awesome try it,6
product received for free  this game is really good for a free to play,17
yes there are pay walls but its not pw and it could get really grindy at times but over all graphics and gameplay is goodplus they are adding more things for freeno dlc needed unlike some other fp or paid gamesalso more fun with friends good community even without a friend group,8
tons of content love the gameplay mod and dojo systems are neat best fp model out there imo characters warframes are fun  however game really needs more info presented ingame and i personally hate the story twist,-1
the best fp ever,10
has tons of content nice gunplay and a nice community,4
amazing experience not really comparable to any other game on the market,-1
tons of fun fair and rewarding ever expanding loving and passionate devs,11
interesting game both in shooting and close combat,-1
this game is like destiny or anthem but wayyyyy better and its free,70
i cant stop playing it,-1
however im having a lot of fun with this game and it doesnt make me feel ill also its third person rather than first person so that helps,36
but thats half the fun,52
only played it for a couple of hours and heres my impression its alright,7
its all very fun and id recommend it for anyone who likes fast paced ninja robot action  tldr this game is good get it you as shole,5
its decent if you like the constant grind,3
just download it you wont regret this,20
its a fun thirdperson shooter and hack and slash game rolled into one,22
after standing in  place in a survival mission for k hours id say it a good game,7
in my opinion this is my favorite free game and it always gets free content and free expansions which is crazy not like destiny,70
mommy bring me a beer,34
great game try playing without spending any money,0
its good to kill time,-1
a great day enjoy the multiplayer aspects great community,4
ive spend a lot of hours in this game and i do not regret even a single one,-1
the game itself is a quick paced shooter for up to  players playing together at the same time,-1
creators of the game keep updating it to make it more interesting and have huge expansion plans in work,12
if you like coop shooters then this game is definatelly worth trying out,24
this game is kinda good,-1
very nice game for a free to play game almost like destiny d,70
great fp game,10
great game worth every second,-1
worth every penny,20
one of the best free to play games nowadays,0
if you pay you can faster reach the end,8
its a good game fun with friends,15
its free yet not pw its destiny yet a much better game than destiny it has a parkour system similar to titanfall yet feels far more fluid than titanfall it has a diablolike loot system yet the loot is far more fun than diablo without needing to be some stupid mobile spinoff outsourced to a chinese company and the game still receives massive free updates on the regular,70
it brought me here and here i was reborn,43
this has to be the best game in all of existence today every update adds in something amazing the combat system is extremely genuine the difficulty evolution is challenging and the graphics are beautiful,-1
but that doesnt mean im changing my opinion the new war is finally out and it didnt disappoint we got the best cinematic endgame quest to end the year and i think its a good note to end it on,-1
yes yes it is,33
best game i have ever played in my life woooo,54
amazing i hope they do alot more this is alot better the most games that i love,23
like destiny but good,41
this has been my all time favorite games for years,54
so many things to be excited about and a lot more unknown content to come,62
experiencing new warframes new quests and new weapons is what gives me the most excitment,-1
i would say the games only problem for me is when i get stuck in a wall or something but tofix that they have comands that can get you out of those areas but other than that the game is flawless and always fun to play,-1
so i would definately recommend warframe to anyone,-1
id say its a good game,77
best game ever made,64
best game i ever played d,-1
yea it cool,6
active passionate developers and a unique game world that inspires the imagination,11
an excellent fp that more games should take note from,10
i highly recommend you try it you have no reason not to,20
and get a clan as it will make progressing a breeze,75
i recommand a try on this game it is fun you got a lot of things to discover a lot of different missions and missions type and some funny things to do,37
but it is free and  hours of fun for free is still  hours of fun for free and there is not a lot of fp that will give you that lengh of fun,0
its pretty good,29
i like it,16
this game is amazing keep cooking,23
this game is free,0
it rocks,6
great ninja style game wont regret downloading it,5
its a good game and very fun to pplay,77
love the slidey slidey thing,9
wonderful game,50
well worth the money regardless of what youre spending it on,20
i loved this game on xbox one and its probably better on pc though due to certain errors of my own i cant play it on pc yet,1
if you like halo and you liked gears of war and you minus any cursing and you love to fly around the map slicing everything into bits or just like your basic daka daka daka machine gun tactics then this game is for you,-1
also there is some magic stuff for you wizard types,-1
the story for some of the missions is perfect and the droid like guy you talk to is funny,37
in short i would recommend you not just try this game but try it with friends who already play it,13
it is good,29
there is a reason this game is steadily in the top ten most played games on steam,-1
it is when you manage to find your footing in what is a very complicated game a very good game,-1
its the child of developers that genuinely want to make the game they most want to play,11
issa good,74
great game i like it a lot and it keeps on updating and constant evolvingkeep up the good work to the developers,12
that aside this game is a good team play and solo too,36
and u can earn or get ur way though the game without buying and if buying it makes a great progress too but can be outrunned so not an pay to win game best part,8
the game is still in beta so the bugs keeps bothering u tho it is ok for the part of game and all is good so can excuse that  u can play the way class u like mele or ranged or mixed combo  its one of the great free to play games u can go and at beggning doin solo might trouble u try pubilc host that would help to get ur way out of it,36
overall a great game u will enjoy    update well game is even better tho the bugs still there they most bugs are fixed right away but lingering ones are well they wont even look at those to fix but focused on more content but the content they realeas gets new bugs and they fix the main trouble some bugs and keep going on,12
still love the game,-1
this game gets better and better what about bugs and lags well they are there but still like the game,-1
this is my first review for a game on steam so it will be short and direct this game has some of the most fun movement dynamics of any mmo,9
that coupled with the combat possibilities provides an experience unlike any other,9
as any mmo may have its share of problems all that aside i consider this game to be a masterpiece,-1
it is definitely worth at least a one time experience but it might have you coming back for more,20
i hope you enjoy a good grind,3
hours later and im still enjoying warframe,32
good game,45
awesome for a free game,0
lots of cool and different features,-1
i liked the idea of the tower defense map they had intially,-1
i just saw that i playd this game over  h and i gota say this game is a lot of fun playing it,-1
sometimes this game takes easily some games which cost a lot of moeny when you first paying itz kinda of complicated but when you getting used to the game itz very cool with all the trading system and staff like this,8
it is rly a lot of fun,-1
this game stands above its free to play competition in every aspect,0
while it does have its share pf bugs no one can deny its gameplay as well as graphics are on par with that of aaa titles id happily recommend anyone who is looking for a time consuming well developed game to give it a try,-1
perfect game,-1
its okay,58
a good coop game to play if you have  people to play with,24
,2
great optimalization of the game i was able to play on my old pc without problems many options for the playstyle interesting story not too shabby customization options for your suits here you go ordis,1
very satisfying to play with friends as well as solo,36
only  hours till now but i think ill stick around for a long time,7
one of the best if not the best imo fp games out there,10
combat is fast and fluid theres a great variety of warframes and weapons story is convoluted in a good way,-1
and very engaging,-1
regular free updates both big and small keeps me interested where other games lose me,12
this is one of two fp games i dont regret throwing money at,10
the new player experience has been improved over the years but dont hesitate to ask questions in game,4
the community is incredibly helpful,4
and its free to play so why not give it a try,0
,2
game good,45
pretty good amazing graphics and stuff,1
very nice game and addictive,21
product received for free  warframe is the best on offer in fp gaming,27
its an incredible title that gives so so much to its players and expects nothing in return,-1
the best way to spend a lot of time,-1
highly addictive and very grindy but soooo much fun,21
highly reccomended,25
awesome smooth gameplay,56
anything is obtainable in this game no matter what,8
player coop ninjastyle gameplay with awesome graphics for a free to play game awesome lore included,-1
product received for free  warframe has been growing and growing,27
updates everywhere full of content,12
honestly this game has grown so much i cant wait to see what comes next,-1
or maybe youll drop a ton of hours into this and adore it like me,7
some of the best things about this game are the graphics are good and the game is well optimized great world building and universe hack and slash combat as well as excellent gunplay lots and lots and lots of weapons variety of characters to play as warframes the best free to play model i have ever seen can trade ingame items for premium currency only items not available through normal missions are cosmetics which can be bought with premium currency etc,-1
good game i like,45
basic gameplay is very solid there is a lot to do and general quality is high,-1
if you can withstand some repetitiveness grinding and bugs after big updates i absolutely recommend this game,3
this kind of graphic in this free game is flawless and the gameplay really nice,1
pros  looks amazing  you are a ninja in space with superpowers and access to every weapon you can think of and loads you cant  fair business model  great community  great devs  free updates  runs well and scales well lots of options  controls are easily customisable  incredibly deep will take you weeks to explore half the game mechanics  absurd amount of character customisation  has space doggos and space kitties  cons  you will encounter bugs most get fixed fairly fast some dont  you wont have access to everything straight away theres a lot of unlocking to do which will take time  grinding not much of a con imo see hours played you will have to run the same thing multiple times to get that thing you want  things get changed that amazing weapon you use all the time might not be so good after the next update  summary  its free worth a try unless you are allergic to space,47
this game got it right make a game thats fun and open and lets you run around with out any type of real annoying block to ruin your fun that you are forced to get around with money,8
its fast fun and can get crazy and the weapons are a great deal of fun toonot the one really the same and each have there own feel if you will can sit down and play it for a fast second or dash about with friends or randoms,-1
the randoms are kind and niceevery one is helpful and can take a joke andand know what team work is for the most part,4
whats more fun then space ninjas,5
great,6
d this game is awesome guys,23
one of the most stable and enjoyable betas ive ever seen,59
fast frantic action which is a beauty to watch and play and will without a doubt make you feel like an absolute badass,9
its accessable making it easy to play but still requiring some skill to pull off those really cool attacks and manuevers,-1
a very nice balance and hopefully the game will only improve,-1
good,74
one of the best freetoplay games out there,49
the begginning is difficult to go through but after that it can be a very rewarding and awesome game,-1
this game is a must,13
basically what im saying is the game is beautiful for a free to play and i cant stress this enough this game is not and i mean not pay to win of course you can buy things to help you progress a little faster but it doesnt effect us players so who cares,8
survival is probably the best game mode so much fun and truely addictive,-1
i can totally see myself racking up a ton of gameplay hours on this,7
its fun,52
enjoy the fun parts avoid the not so fun parts like every game you play stay busy in life so this isnt the only thing in your life and youll have fun,-1
now that ive tested out the game lil bit i could say its fun way to spend time and even more fun if you play with friends,15
i highly recommend trying out the life of space ninja,5
good looking game,50
good,74
,2
is a pretty good game,-1
youre welcome,6
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than destiny  imo but hey to each their own,-1
i think i do indeed enjoy this,16
everything else is great about this game,23
i absolutely love this game,28
it is the definition of a amazing free to play experience although you will need to spend some money to get the full experience,0
it is very much worth it in my opinion,20
also supporting indie devs gives you a nice feeling  but the meat meat of the gameplay is the third person ninja shooter,5
being a space ninja ou are very agile and can pull off parkour with ease,5
the gunplay is satisfying and has a lot of impact with great sound assests make hearing and feeling the pop of a headshot,9
i cannot reccomend this game enough,13
pretty good so far,6
if only it was for mac,30
product received for free  not bad,17
a game that is worth a try and trust me if youre into grinding this game is a go to for most of you,3
a leading role in vukmirs production will provide financial support to milos and his family for the rest of their lives,66
its not too bad,29
its a really good game with a lot of potential,77
product received for free  this game is worth of every second ive spent on it and i would encourage anyone to give warframe a try,27
however once you get past that you wont regret it  the game is truly unique and carries such a wide variety in so many aspects,-1
yes the game is completely free,0
but i wont say too much as discovering things within the game will be so much more rewarding and or surprising,-1
so once again give warframe a try,-1
im loving this game never gets boring and never will because there constently updating it,12
even though i spent a little bit of time on warframe such a great game and ill defenetly be playing more,32
i must say the game is excellent in almost every way if u enjoy scifi action but if u have time to waste as well it wuld be the perfect game for u i may not have played as long as most but ive realised that this game is just a repetitive masterpiece,22
u spend hours trying to new equipment only to find that there is even stronger ones coming out later which of cause u will and want and spend more hours farming to get it so if u got nothing to do anymore and enjoy scifi action i would recommend because i have to admit this is a good game,35
it is a grind but its supposed to be and ive been enjoying every moment,3
the crafting system works well and you feel accomplished when you finally collect enough parts for a new item,8
i felt lost at first and still do on some things but the journey is a blast,-1
best part is that its free,30
after my experience thus far i will pay just to support the devs,-1
the parkour is amazing and the number of warframes each a class of its own with the crazy synergy between their abilities have to check the wiki,14
but if you can get past that hurdle it is an amazing game with a ton of content,-1
i love this game,28

warframe is currently entering a little bit of a golden age  every new update comes with insane quality of life changes buffs to older frames or new enjoyable content,55
the devs actually listen and care about their community the difference between the first heirloom pack and the second speaks volumes to this,11
no developer can be perfect and de misstep but they listen and learn and for that i cannot fault them,11
if you enjoy the playstyle then warframe is a game youll come back to again and again for years,32
cannot recommend giving it a try enough but if youre new watch some guides before you step in,20
really fun game just a bit short,46
product received for free  well at the first pointgame is pretty optimized and you can play it even on low power graphics,17
story is fun and worth it to play it,18
game play is awesome the movements especially,9
and the option and customization is also greatto be honest its kinda hard at the first point there are to many options and you need to customize each ones the best thing is the online mod which is pretty suitable for this game butmaybe its just for me but some times lagging or server delay may happens,39
rank up and level up is so simple in this game and its pretty fast,-1
i really addicted to this game if you play it onceyou cant close it,21

theres so much to do graphics are decent gameplay in general is great and the microtransaction system isnt bs,1
product received for free  this is a game that can be very frustrating at times but it can also be very rewarding more so when playing with friends,17
also has some of the best story content late game that adds so much to the experience,18
,2
great storydriven gameplay with lots of new content regularly and even some old content making a return every now and then for those who missed out the first second and third times or more,-1
not only is it wellwritten of a story but the devs even listen to the community and even interact with their players as well on dev streams and more,11
not only are the devs great but they developed this game with all kinds of people in mind and it is suberbly done fitting our world into the world of the tenno grineer corpus sentients and more,11
join the fun and save the world from the new war,-1
just amazing,6
this overall a very great game even though it can get a bit overwhelming for new players you will learn everything while playing and you can always ask the great community of tenno,44
i definately recommend this game,13
i love this game so far,28
it is very addictive and easy to play,21
i do recommend this game,13
ill definitely update at another time when i have play longer and discovered more,12
still grinding,3
this is the game i definitely will spend my resources well and to invest into this game,-1
thank you de and steam,-1
all these years and its still going strong,57
a very captivating game,-1
is gud,71
i have been playing warframe since it originally launched founder before it was on steam,32
like any game it has had its ups and downs but i give props to de for staying engaged with the people who play their game,68
they have successfully cultivated a community and listen to play feedback,11
i can always come back to this game and expect something new and exciting,-1
if you can slog through some of the terrible beginning content you can get to an amazing game,53
warframe is updated all the time and has one of the best communities out there,55
i believe that its still very enjoyable solo but of course its way better with friends,36
is this game fun,46
yes,33
yes,33
personally i believe theyve done a good job with everything and de having reworked two of the warframes that have fallen out of popularity shows that theyre trying to keep everything relevant,-1
overall id give this game my probably biased seal of approval,-1
although the start is considered boring by many other players once u get to know more about this game and start to invest time into it this game will become a very rewarding game thats worthy of ur time,-1
warframe is the most enjoyable mobile game i have ever played,19
warframe is a great game,19
despite having its ups and downs the developers really do care about this game,-1
movement is fluid and smooth and you feel like a god bulletjumping and running through maps,9
there is always something to look forwards to and even after about  hours just in missions i can never run out of things to do,37
i really do recommend you take a look at this game you wont regret it,13
fantastic game one of the best examples of free to play games ever,0
ok   edit game is very good   edit game is better than    edit game is better than,76
its an alright game,-1

the new graphics engine is pretty good,1
definitely a really grindy type of game but if you like that then this is perfect,3
pretty decent,6
who am i kidding its great,29
,2
i played it for a while seems good so far,7
content island tldr cetus was okay for the first set i did enjoy hunting terry harry and garry a lot,67
fortuna had cool story and some interesting missions with the gta alert system but the finale fight was unintuitive and lacking but i made sure i could do it and farm it solo,38
always something new to do here,-1
creators are always creating something new,-1
its best when played with others,36
this game is something else it started out as a simple third person shoot and loot game with space ninjas clunkily hopping around the place with all kinds of weapons it was interesting but not a real eye catcher back then but fast forward all these years and weve arrived at a game with more content and thought put behind it than most triple a games that are being published these days,5
the devs focus on player fun rather than profit also helps a lot to keep this game going in the right direction,11
the best free game around,0
warframe is an awesome game with surprisingly indepth systems,19
it can be a bit daunting for new players due to its complexity but the community is always happy to help out,4

but a friend recently talked me through the game so i am coming around,15
for a free game it is pretty decent so far,0
awesome game,65
at first it is interresting but odd due to the lack of help from the game itself but the community makes up for that big time,4
in the long run it can get boring but they keep adding new content wich is amazing,12
the game does have its flaws but they keep updating to fix it  i highly recommend this game,-1

the community is one of if not the best social communinities for the genre,4
everyone is helpful everyone is willing to teach you something new and everyone is willing to make friends with people on the basis that yes we are all here together,4
best community,4
also everything gameplay wise is free and if you grind n trade tm enough even the fancy clothes can be obtained without spending a real penny in this game except some really fancy clothing especially if it has gold somewhere in it,8
the game can be a little bit on the grindy side but its a free to play game which is done quite well,3
the game does heavily succeed at making you feel very powerful,-1
i love how the devs support potatoes up to pc masterraces,1
but fashion and looks are great,1
i play this game since launch,59
and i like it,16
one of the best coop mission games,24
it is a growing community and playing it takes your steam off,4
its awesome,6
,2
now i dont pay attention to what happens in this game very much nor am i far at all but i can say it runs beautifully,1
gameplay wise its fun but what i have played is a little repetetive although my buddies that have literally thousands of hours in this game say it changes,-1

highly addictive great but unexperienced developers good and helpful community with frequent updates and new gameplay improvements,-1
this game took all my time but it is sooo fun,-1
ive been playing this game on and off agin for the last  years since its release on steam as it does get repetative but that good repetative ya know,-1
digital extreme creators has built a world that you can get really into with the lore and different styles of enemies,42
also with them pumping out constant content is what keeps drawing me back to this game,53
all in all i love this game but im always playing alone so it gets tedious at time grinding away by my lonesome,36
but yes of corse i very much recommend this game,13
not for everyone but a solid enjoyable combat system layered on a damn fantastic movement system,9
the game also has a great suportive community and friendly dev to player comuication which is always a bonus,11
i will also note that i played this game for  hours before giving the game a dime but i had such a good time i felt that deserved it,-1
very much recomended,25
awesome game,65
if you like destiny then you will surely love this game,84
very fun and addictive,21
the graphic is great and the gameplay is amzing,1
its great that most of the prime equipment you can get through grinding enemies but this can also be time consuming,3
maybe better than destiny,41
only been playing for a few hours but it seems like a decent enough game,7
dear future tenno this is a game about working hard towards your goal of becoming a badass armedtotheteeth bonified space ninja,5

thank you for reading i hope this helped you it certainly helped me,4
the various frames have diverse enough ability spreads to allow for endless funk,14
endless,-1
hey you have to try this game out pretty standard and easy plus online play is fun,-1
if you seek to play this amazing game id recommend a team of four you and three of your ninjaest friends with some form of vocal interaction such as teamspeak or discord as voice settings arent really prevalent or high value,5

this game has hours and hours of gameplay if you dont mind the grinding it will keep entertained for atleast a few month,3
this game is awesome,23
this game is great to play with friends and have some fun,15

that being said i would recommend it,25
i would still be playing this game if there were more updates or more immersion in gameplay,-1
though i still recommend this game as i have played it over a  hours myself,7
warframe is very unique as a third person shooter free to play its not pay to win style and a lot of the weapons are easy to get without the purchase of money,-1

i recommend this to people who search for a game they can get things fast and with no money cost,0
yes,33
but its awesome,-1
a wonderful free to play game that doesnt shove microtransactions down your throat,-1
i found warframe one night tooling around on steam looking for something to replace them and what a replacement i found,-1
warframe gave me the pve and the grindycollection i was looking for,81
to keep blabbering on about what a good game it is would be repititious so ill leave you with this if you like pve person coop extreme character agility ability powers and all with somewhat grindy crafting system that you can make a multitude of unique weapons with interchangeable mods you will like this game,78
