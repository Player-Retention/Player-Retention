The first descendant,Catherine Snow,"Product received for free  In the beta test you could craft paints for free to add a flavour of unique to your character, Nexon decided to remove this in the official game. Instead now you are charged 25 of the in game paid currency the smallest bundle costs around £4 to get 250. That in itself doesn't seem too pricey until you notice that you don't get to keep that paint despite paying for it. Say for example you want to paint a torso piece and it has say 5 slots you can customise. You'll need to buy x5 paints even if its the same colour JUST to paint it fully. If you purchased the 250 in game currency bundle you'd immediately spend 125 of it right away, on paint.  People may say stuff like ''It's a free game they need money'' my friend, wait until you see the costs of skins in the shop oh and did I mention you CANNOT customise with paint the base game appearance for your character it literally forces you to pay for a skin and then forces you to pay if you want to paint it. Imagine if you apply the wrong one by mistake. Yikes.  It gives you the option to buy every single item to void farming for it which is basically the core aspect of the game that's on top of being able to rush crafting instead of waiting but even then why bother going through all that when you can buy characters fully made and ready to use?  Haven't even gotten to the best part here you can pay for extra upgrades to your character, at this current time I don't actually know if it's even possible for free to use players to get that chance but, I wouldn't be shocked if they can't considering the track history of taking down games nexon has after getting your money.  Other points to note that isn't money motivated is that you can actually get in the way of people during combat. Body blocking is SO FUN when you're trying to use a range ability isn't nexon? Not even the option to crouch down in this game and let people engage in combat while you duck down out the way.  I have a modern pc and graphics card I checked the requirements for the game before downloading it and I can more than handle the game and yet what's this ? Stuttering sure okay not frequent but the fact it happens at all? It's a cop out to say it's because of the servers nexon has had plenty of time to prepare for it and after the full 10 hours or more that the game went down for and it still happens?  Check the terms of service did you notice what they want access to? It's more than suspicious don't you think considering the amount of encouragement you get to buy stuff.  During the beta test alot of the community complained about the character Bunny wanting her to be one of the easier characters to obtain earlier on. She has quickly became the poster girl for the game that in itself is perfectly fine until you play the game. She is easily the most brokenly overpowered character currently in the game which is why so many users are mainly using her.  You may wonder now is there even any good points to the game that can be noted? The only thing I truly have to say in the light of positive is that the cut scenes are very pretty to watch but that's it.  My overall opinion is to avoid the game for now, If you still want to play it that's entirely your choice but if you do don't buy anything for a couple of months, what's the point in paying for stuff if the game gets taken offline after a short period of time? The more the community fuels nexons greed the worse it's be this is not how gamers should be treated. If you want a game that's free and does justice to both free and paid members go and play Warframe.",Not Recommended,2024.07.05,110.4

The first descendant,ackwell,"Wasn't able to play this as it is gatekept by first having to accept a data collection policy.  ToS fine, every service needs a ToS. But forcing you to accept an insane data collection policy before being able to play the game and then in the fine print say that you may opt out of the data collection API by contacting Nexon support (with more or less a broken link that just takes you to a blank search page on their website) is annoying.  When you submit a request to their support for disabling data collection (no word as of yet how that will play out since I never accepted it to begin with), they ask you for more personal information and they require you to accept their privacy policy where it states they will collect that personal information too. So in order to not want data collection you have to contact their support, but in order to contact their support you have to let them collect your personal information.  Why isn't there an option when you start the game where you can accept their Terms of Service, but not the data collection policy? If you are able to opt-out the data collection, then why aren't you able to NOT opt-in in the first place?  Edit 2024-07-04: I checked again if you could in fact proceed with only checking the ToS box and skip the 3rd Party Data Collection box. You could not. You either manually have to check both boxes and accept, or you can click the other button that says ""Agree to all and Start"" which is literally the same thing  Edit 2024-07-11: Still haven't heard back from their support. Safe to assume they are not inclined to actually help me bypass their ""optional"" 3rd party data collection policy.",Not Recommended,2024.07.03,0.3

The story, writing, and voice acting are all pretty terrible. But that kind of thing I can forgive if the gameplay is good. However, what I can't forgive is the way the end game is designed. The endgame grind is a nightmare. It is overly grindy and convoluted as can be. They have sabotaged their own game design in order to implement a super toxic monetization scheme. They want players to feel frustrated and confused so that they are incentivized to pull out their wallets in order to improve their experience.

However once you hit 40, it becomes a grind of redoing the map on hard mode with the same content grinding for perfect rolls and items to then defeat boss content.  The entire end game is only grinding over and over for supplies so that you can attempt hard mode bosses. In order to do this, you have to craft items that reset your level from 40 to 1 so you can do it again and again to better your skills. It is not for a part time gamer but a fulltime streamer,  I really like playing the game, but this grind for gear is just unreal. For example, they have one character that hacks information and in order to get skills for them you have to go across maps and hack areas over and over again, upwards of 60 times to get a drop.

The first descendant,Greyed,"The TL;DR of The First Descendant is that it is a cargo cult game. It takes the systems from several other games, mashes them together with no true understanding of why those systems are the way they are, and as a result makes errors which show it to be nothing but a pale comparison to the originals it mimics.  Here's but one example to show what I mean. The weapons.  The weapons in TFD have mod slots that can have polarities, and an unlock to add more mod points. Mods have a cost, with more powerful mods costing more. Weapons have a maximum limit on how many mod points they can have. This is exactly like Warframe.  But, weapons also have levels. A level 1 weapon is patently inferior to the same weapon at level 20, which is patently inferior to the same weapon at level 60, which is patently inferior to the same weapon at 100. Yes, weapons can go up to level 100. And I am underselling the power creep. A weapon that is a mere 3-4 levels behind the curve feels underpowered, even with a full set of mods. While getting the same weapon at a higher level, makes it feel powerful again.  How is this cargo cultish? Because in Warframe's build system the mods were what determined a weapon's power and feel. Sure, there was a short levelling curve (20 minutes in one well known XP farm) which serves more as a testing ground for the weapon. But once that was passed building out a weapon with the appropriate mods, and tweaking that build, is how one brought out the full potential of the weapon.  Comparatively the weapon level system, which is seen in other looter shooter series like The Division or Borderlands, provided its own method of weapon improvement. You got the weapon, its level determined its power. The only way to improve the weapon was to find a higher level variant.  Nexon thought that by simply mimicing those systems they would replicate the success of either, but y mashing the two systems together it ruins both approaches. Mods are cheapened until you hit max level, and levels are weakened by not having a solid set of mods to back it up. They have no understanding why both approaches work.  The same goes for Descendants, for the maps, the missions, the bosses, and even the battlepass! They all are carbon copies of other games, often mashed together, without any understanding as to why the other games' design decisions drove their individual successes.  I have no doubt that the thirst trap of the titular character, a Bargin Bin Volt in a D.Va skin (right down to the same color scheme), will easily allow them to recoup their costs of development and may keep a modest player base playing for many months to come. But, much like their other titles, the burdensome monitization will eventually drive away but the most deep pocketed whales who succumb to their sunk cost fallacy.",Not Recommended,2024.07.11,51.6
The first descendant,SarcasmSince1996,"While I have really enjoyed this game for about 130 hours or so the grind is just getting really bad. I also found getting my first ultimate numbingly boring and finally getting the character felt underwhelming as i can't really tell a difference between the ult character and the base character. Even after leveling back up to 40 twice. Which is unfortunate considering how expensive it is to buy one and how bad the drop rates for ultimate characters and how long it took to get. Even worse the grind for the new season one descendant is even worse as you need 36 things to craft each individual part which comes out to 144 parts with the really bad drop rates. I lost count how many times i have run one of the missions and i still only have 6 of the 144 required, and this is after a supposed increase for the drops. Its a fun game with fun mechanics but unfortunately suffers from a long and unrewarding grind. Hopefully the developers can find a better balance because i can see this causing a lot of players to loose interest and also turn off new players as well.",Not Recommended,2024.09.15,147.9

It's really poor optimization, and I also refuse to use stupid Frame Generation since it creates input latency.

The first descendant,ATAKAN,"As much as I enjoy the gunplay and the core gameplay loop. I can not recommend this game for the life of me. In simple terms, there is a lot of potential here. - The environments are gorgeous. - The animations are really well done. - The bossfights look very very cool (Stunning Beauty) - The guns feel good and somewhat diverse. But sadly, that's where all the good ends. Although the environments are beautiful, they are not optimized. My setup is stronger than the recommended specs on the game's steam page yet I have to adjust most graphical settings to low to get a stable 60fps and this issue is all the more saturated in the main hub. I barely manage 40fps there. That wouldn't be a deal breaker for me, if it was the only issue. This game is simply too greedy. All means of upgrade, regardless of weapons or descendants, it'll be an agonizing grind to do it for free. They've done literally all they can to push you to spend money. That even shows in their battlepass, which wastes the experience you earn by only rewarding you once every 3~4 levels without the premium purchase. There is very little customization offered for free in the game (if at all). The first descendant has clearly taken quite the inspiration from warframe but knowing that most of their player base are already spoiled with the extensive customization warframe offers, and yet they still decided to charge for each paint job individually and lock everything behind an ingame currency which to my knowledge is impossible to earn in-game. all-in-all, there is a looooot of potential here. Despite the issues, I still enjoyed the few hours I spent mowing down enemies. I wish the publisher understands this simple point. The community will sit through the jank. we will wait for updates no matter how long it takes. What we won't tolerate and stay for is unreasonable greed. I've played for 17 hours and I can count on one hand how many rare items and guns I got. There is hope for this game to shine if the drop tables are adjusted. The bugs, addressed.

This isn't a passion project, this is a project made entirely with microtransactions in mind.  While games like Warframe are also very grindy by nature, at least those games are fun. This game isn't, the grinding is a chore. The gunplay is absolutely awful, the skills feel okay but once they're on cooldown you're back to using the awfully boring gunplay again. The environments are empty, super boring and look like your average asset flip title, doesn't look cohesive at all.  The result is a horribly stale and boring universe, with boring and generic characters and classes. It has no charm, no soul. It's just a cash-grabbing game trying to appeal to people with cringey lewd female skins.  It probably gets better later on, but the new player experience is absolutely awful while being important for a generic game like this to maintain its players.  For example, there's no way to limit what kind of players you get matchmaked with, so it suffers from the same issue as Warframe does.

Ajax (one of the playable characters) sounds so bored IRL that it bleeds into the performance (I don't think the VA is a bad person or anything like that, just that the pay must not have been good).

There is coop play in this game either by grouping or just doing the zones as people drop in.  The characters are fine too although how you make your character stronger is a bit complicated for me.  I have no problem with some grind but to have to spend a crazy amount of time and money getting even normal stuff is not very fun.  There will be people who say I am dumb or it's not for me. But that is not true. I like the core game as far as combat and story goes. I don't mind spending some money but not be forced to do it because I am bored or irritated.  As I said in my first iteration of the review the amount of grind and waiting for stuff to be made just takes the fun out of the game.  Once Human has a great model. You get a lot of good stuff just playing and the premium stuff you have to buy which I am fine with. The season pass in that game is better too.  There is a season pass in TFD too. I guess that is fine to get some stuff. But looking at it it still isn't worth paying for because you still need to do a lot of grind and purchasing to advance even just cosmetically.  My whole reason for playing these kinds of grindy games is making my character look better. Having nice gun skins is great too but the grind is not what keeps me coming back. How I am rewarded for my time does.  I don't know if that all makes sense but that my take.  To be honest I will come back and play TFD a little here and there but I am not dumping my money into this one. Maybe an outfit or two. That is it.

Edit: Yeah so after four more hours I just think its worse than the other options like Warframe or Destiny 2, Its not completely garbage or anything and it has potential, but I just find the game play more boring than the examples and it feels overall more greedy than both Warframe and Destiny with its premium content along with the lack of player trading Warframe has, which I think would be a great inclusion in this game. Overall though its not a terrible game by any means, it just isnt there yet. I dont know anything about the dev team so I do hope that they will listen to the community and make this game great in the future but at the moment I just find it pretty boring.

Don't forget that to open said ball, you need to farm for material C and D on a mission which can only be acquired optimally by using characters with certain elements.  Oh, and don't forget that materials C and D are NOT independently used; if you need 35 material C and 10 material D to finish the quest to open the ball, and you have a party of 4, the materials will be consumed by all of your party members, not just the one who initiated the quest.

The first descendant,Brian,"This game just makes me want to play Warframe. I have a very positive bias towards Warframe, but the similarities are endless. The modding, Descendant abilities, and leveling systems all remind me of Warframe, because they are basically copies of it; even the mastery rank system is there. There are some Destiny features in there as well, such as weapon infusion and whatnot (which is so expensive and inconvenient that I didn't even make it far enough in the game to make it worthwhile), and there are Ultimate weapons that draw similarities to Destiny's Exotic weapons, such as ""The Cage"", which is basically Destiny's Thunderlord if you made it an SMG. If we are ignoring my comparisons, this game feels clunky most of the time. I never use the grappling hook, I feel like I can't jump or move to where I want to go a lot of the time, the AI in this game is not impressive my any means, and the only reason why it puts up any semblance of a threat is because after the second or third area, your Descendant becomes as brittle as glass. It's an enormous difficulty spike out of nowhere and it feels painfully artificial. I called it quits after going through the game's dungeons and getting irritated at how these boss encounters usually went (keep in mind that I'm a solo player). The game will constantly spawn enemies while the boss fight is happening, which makes it really hard to get any damage in. You don't really need a ton of time, but it's annoying how the game NEVER stops the ad spawning. The bosses also typically come with some crazy regeneration, healing abilities, and have 3 ""phases"", which I will simply call ""moments of immunity"" because that's all they really are, and this combination of traits and abilities makes all of these fights insufferable IMO. The significance of this is that you have to run these dungeons constantly (it's a grind game after all), but the dungeons are not fun. I was originally gonna see how long it was going to take me to grind out one of the Ultimate skins in the game, but I don't really want to do that anymore. As I was writing this, the thought of ""mad because bad"" came to my mind. It's kinda funny, but at the same time, I usually like pushing back on a game's difficulty because it feels good to do so. I can't say the same for this game. Because of that, I just can't say that this game is worth a try. Hopefully it will be in the future.  ---  On a side note, why is this game's audio SO bad?! The voice acting is bad, the music doesn't evoke anything from me or even match the pacing of the game, the guns don't have balls, your characters don't make sounds as they're running and walking, the environments don't have any ambiance; it's disturbingly dull and lifeless, and I'm not going to give this game credit and say that it was doing that intentionally.",Not Recommended,2024.07.19,14.4

The first descendant,Aden,"TL;DR The game is literally Outriders and Warframe except more Pay 2 Skip the grind with the rendering shaders like Call of Duty  (Also yes I realize im being an ass on release and the fact that its F2P means they have to make money somehow but again thats what battle passes, cosmetics, and top-up currency is for)  Edit: I realize I didn't mention the fact that the gamechat doesn't have a filter or atleast for people using special characters to use slurs, thought I'd make sure to mention it now.  1. had lots of load times of pre-shadering and when you think its done and you wont have to do it again, nah thats happening often  2. played outriders? its gonna feel like that but the skills actually do damage.  3. people complaining the game is too easy, that's true for certain missions and dependent on your gear, if you have the appropriate gear the game will be easy for a majority of the time, its only hard in instances where you need to be stationary for an objective like, 'defend this' or 'capture the point to keep hacking' where enemies may get you low when there's a major horde of tanky enemies but other than that the enemies might just destroy your objective which is the only thing you may lose too LOL. (also another thing the missions you do have limit respawns before failing, the game tells you with a counter, and honestly is way too generous with it as the easiest mission had 8 respawns available)  4. Pay to win is pretty present in the game from the moment you get to the hub area, as you immediately decide 'hey what are my other options for descendants?' you check it out and realize 'oh I can buy them?' just to see you can yes with either in game currency and materials, which you need to craft after grinding them out to drop from certain objectives as well as wait real time hours to craft them, granted the first descendant they give you only take a minute as most mobile games with time waiting mechanics do (with the skip feature of paying real world currency to skip the timer) and warframe, speaking of warframe just like that game you can pay for real world currency which allows you to just straight up buy the descendant hell you could buy their counter part, the ultimate version of certain units, which I have no clue what is the difference but I can only assume its the same as having a prime warframe.",Not Recommended,2024.07.02,2.8

The first descendant,Guvna Hlep,"Good game,  Beautiful visuals.  Lacks new player friendliness, which those of us coming from warframe are just awaiting a wiki being built tbh.  The problems start with the grind, sure games like this have grinds and it makes it so they can make money and that we can earn anything. But the fact there is no pity system for grinding the same thing over and over, like a pity currency or increased odds etc, just sucks the fun out of it, which leads to the next point,  A lot of resources or parts you need have multiple avenues to obtain them, which is great, but some do not, leading you again, to repeat the same thing over and over until you get it.  The game could also benefit from completing its tracking system. You can currently set parts or resources to track, but the system stops there, it doesnt tell you where, how and sometimes there is a part required to get the other part. An expansion on this would be great.  And lastly, the reason i even left a review. I always have to launch the game twice or 3 times. Once its open its stable and has no issues.

The first descendant,Nightwing,"Having been in development for awhile and after numerous play tests, the game still feels like a mix between a beta and a mobile game. Riddled with performance issues and from my experience server issues. I've seen a lot of people compare it to Warframe and Destiny 2, both of which I have around 1500 hours in (combining PC and Playstation). Warframe excels on the free to play aspect with everything (besides some community skins) earn-able in game. Destiny is not free to play no matter what they advertise. But is a very polished game and amazing to play with friends. Personally I don't think it really holds up in the genre. I'll stick with the game for a little longer but it just doesn't feel enjoyable. I'd rather spend my time in Warframe or Destiny than playing this game.  Monetisation is garbage and you shouldn't have to pay real money for more character slots.",Not Recommended,2024.07.03,8.0
The first descendant,A Real Dragon Girl,"It's Warframe but worse. It's Destiny but worse. It's ANTHEM but worse. If you like endless grind looter shooters with lots of character kits to sink hours into and don't give a thought to any other design elements besides what guns to use and what mods to plug in, you'll like this. If you have anything that keeps you from enjoying noncohesive gameplay systems and the progression therein, and chafe at the prevalence of nondescript PNGs and poorly explained statuses and bolded verbs and adjectives you need to pay attention to, go elsewhere.  It's flashy and energetic and full of the most overly-designed characters and guns and setpieces that UE5 can render, but without any meaningful substance to back any of it up. Guns sound meaty but have no feeling for handling, character movements are weightless even with heavier classes, ability use has little meaningful feedback and impact and just sort of occurs, and all the animations for every character are just too much. There comes a point where the big armor pauldron has simply moved around and too much. Sound design overall is alarmingly poor but also overengineered; booms and techno fwooooms are way too loud and frequent to be enjoyed and guns just sound like modern ""insert sci-fi weapon type here"" stock packs. The only sound that has any serious chop to it is the hitmarker and headshot SFX which are suitably crunchy and satisfying.  Character kits have all the hallmarks of classic archetypes we've been seeing for a decade and there's little in the way of anything new and exciting. The tank makes a big wall and sometimes a dome and sometimes does a big stomp, the damage guy has explosives and fire damage for DoT, the CC lady makes lightning jump around between enemies for big clears, you've seen all of this before. Other characters have more stock kits and very few look to be a worthwhile grind; I wouldn't know, I'm not made of enough money to buy any of these things comfortably.  When you're actually running around shooting stuff with your team of randoms or friends it can feel like there's something to latch on to. Your abilities are going off, you're shooting the same big boys together and whittling down their health bars, you're clearing groups of enemies with accidental symbiosis, and you can feel that there's something here you can latch on to. You'll pick up your new guns and mods and compare stats that mean nothing but make numbers go higher, so you'll at least feel some sense of your strength as a character getting higher. In these moments, First Descendant may finally feel like a fun time.  And then you'll be ripped out of the experience to talk to the next poorly-voiced NPC who gives you a new quest to go shoot the next Florbo, Scourge of Bungo but only after you watch another overacted cutscene and talk to 4 other NPCs who do nothing but fill out objective markers that are ""Talk to Scrungo to upgrade your Bits"". You'll have to talk to the one NPC who can make your mods stronger for an increasing fee every time because the idea of you upgrading anything without having to run around the social area is seemingly too much for Nexon. At least that way you can maybe see a player wearing that other character you REALLY want to play with and feel pressured into spending money to get them faster.  You've seen this grind a dozen times by now: get the Small Bit to make the Bigger Bit to make the big newest Toy to play with. Run the same activities over and over and over to collect PNGs that may not be the PNG you need right now, but at least you're collecting stuff! If you're impatient, you can pay money to skip the ""research"" time so you can use your new Toy sooner. Uh-oh, what's that? The rush payment is just a little too much for just one pack of premium currency? Hope you don't work minimum wage to afford that rush AND the new skin that other player was using that looks REALLY cool. And the premium battle pass, because it's free to play but not free to progress.  It's nothing new, it's the same stuff we've seen time and time again from these kinds of games. It's slop. It's artists turned loose with no oversight and designers answering to overlords trying to make a functioning videogame out of the disparate art assets being turned in. A producer steps into the office to see a demo and leaves 5 minutes in because it runs. An investor is at his own little desk running projections and salivating. If you get enjoyment out of this type of stuff, then you'll be comfortable here.

The first descendant,BeyondLucky,"Have you ever wanted to do something but once you start you realize you dont want to anymore and then the cycle repeats?  Thats this game due to its downright annoying grind cycle. I like to grind honestly, games like warframe do it amazingly well and makes it enjoyable. Hell even new world was tolerable with its crafting grind, FFXIV is another good grind game for skills. THIS GAME though sucks ass. You have to grind shards, to grind amorphous to grind parts to grind levels to grind power. And its ALL in different areas and rarely if ever can multiple things be grinded at once unlike games like warframe where you can grind void chests and the material to unlock them AND where to unlock them all at the same time making it more tolerable. Not to mention the people you grind with can also help by you being able to choose their drop. The system in this game needs a complete rework.  The game just came out and there are already to many systems, with it already feeling like it has power creep with how massive they make all their numbers. Games going to die within a year because of power creep, an increase in systems making it overwhelming, or just because its nexon.  Go play Warframe.",Not Recommended,2024.08.26,318.5
The first descendant,R4dioS1lence,"TL;DR: I should've guessed Nexon wasn't going to change. It takes from other games, but learns nothing from them. Reeks of the mobile stink. Any comparisons with Warframe come from people who don't understand Warframe. Probably the same for D-game (but I stopped caring about it).  After playing the last day of the beta test, I couldn't understand how there was so much hype on this. Probably PC gamers tend to not do mobile gaming just out of spite, and then can't see mobile game mechanics on their faces when a PC game does them. Or maybe it's the Unreal Engine 5 hype because ""IT LOOKS GREAT JUST BECAUSE OF IT"".  To put the good out of the way, movement is quite fun, controls are very customizable (very few questionable default binds), and multiplayer is seamless (you get joined in a group with randoms on overworld mini-quests if you both start at similar times, and the group disbands right after).  Praised enough.  For some reason, controller aim is abhorrent. It has some heavy momentum to it, for whatever reason, making it nearly unplayable on controller unless you can stomach that (and there is no option on configurations to remove that). Increasing sensitivity kinda makes it slightly more bearable, but not nearly enough.  Weapons inventory is heavily limited, and weapons drop from enemies all the time. It takes about 30 minutes of gameplay for you to fill up and have to stop and clear inventory while sorting between what is trash to be broken down for resources and what is useful. Since weapons roll with random stats and scale to your level, you're often choke full of useless things, forcing you to stop and read stats constantly. Only way to make it less of a problem is to PAY MONEY to increase inventory size, because QoL is a paid feature.  If you think ""Warframe also has a limited inventory, so what's the problem?"", then you didn't understand inventory limitation and weapon design in this game nor in Warframe. In TFD, inventory limit just creates a countdown timer for the player until they have to stop and clean, since weapons are just loot that drops everywhere. There is no option to automatically discard anything under a given rarity or under your level. Weapons in TFD are just minor loot that range from rifles, DMRs, snipers, shotguns... all the vanilla stuff, and the inventory limit is your time limit until you have to open that screen and sort through your stuff to separate the wheat from the chaff. In Warframe, a weapon is a commitment. You collect resources, parts, blueprints, all that you need to build it. Then, you build it yourself, wait for it to build, and only then, you get to use it. And the weapons in Warframe are so varied, that if you ask someone who doesn't play to think of a crazy weapon, it probably exists in Warframe. Bow that shoots explosives? If it's cluster bombs, there is one, if it's a repeating arbalest with explosive darts there are two of those. A gun that shoots living things? One of them uses your health to reload and leeches from enemies on headshots, and another explodes heads if you get headshots. Hand thrown C4? Sure, we got you covered fam. Charged beam laser? You bet!  The modding system in TFD is another thing lifted from Warframe that is poorly executed, with the mods barely changing the behavior of the weapons. Meanwhile, in Warframe, modding can turn even the weakest weapon into a worthwhile companion, with so many ways to configure each. While optimal modding might be strict for weapons, the Warframes themselves are swiss army knives, and their abilities can even change the way you mod a particular weapon. If you want to ignore increasing fire rate on a weapon, that's fine: Wisp can increase the fire rate so much you won't miss not having modded for it. Even Saryn, who is single-minded and is usually always modded to be a nuke can be changed into one of the best buffers in the game.  Even if with time TFD gains the depth and breadth that other looter shooters have, with multiple useful configurations for each character and weapons that heavily change their gameplay, it still doesn't change the fact that the monetization of QoL on TFD is egregious. Don't take me wrong, developers DESERVE to be paid for their work, and monetization on F2P games is always a touchy subject. Some players treat F2P games as games that don't deserve a penny, sometimes because of the service aspect and the lack of permeance of what you paid for (which is valid), while others don't give money ""just because"" (or hand pick which games are fine to be monetized and which not). But none of that excuses developers (or in most cases, publishers) from making monetization so aggressive to the point where the game is Free 2 Play, but not Free 2 Have Fun unless you whale on it. Warframe does monetize convenience with speeding up weapons, but that doesn't affect new players (who have more things to be built and waiting to be collected than time to use them), only late game players (who can either be patient, or feed the game economy via trading and get premium currency via trading to speed things up), and these costs are low (even the packs for weapons and Warframes aren't heavily expensive), with the brunt of the monetization being focused on cosmetics. But TFD is heavily monetizing convenience, heavily monetizing cosmetics (you even have to buy paints INDIVIDUALLY for EACH APPLICATION, like the old Destiny 2 shaders that were single use).  TFD doesn't respect your money or your convenience, so neither should you respct it.",Not Recommended,2024.07.09,0.1

The first descendant,Incoherent,"This game takes lots of elements from games that we know of such as Warframe, Destiny 2, and Anthem. The combat is amazing, its fluent and has a lot of impact, which is difficult to accomplish for a 3rd person shooter, the movement is nice, and all the abilities are unique in their own ways with the selection of characters you can grind and pick from.  The grind though... is not good in the slightest, it tries to take Warframe's grind motto but they make it 10x more annoying, it can be tedious like most games, but this isn't a good or fun type of tedious grind, infact you will be falling asleep trying to grind for items in this game. Its unenjoyable and honestly a waste of time for grinding for items, but the end game items, the things that should be made difficult to earn, can just easily be bought, which makes the endgame a quick game. Its certainly unbalanced, the level and difficulty scaling is pretty bad, some missions you'll feel extremely overpowered, next mission you'll get 1 tapped without the game really warning you or telling you anything.  The game design is awful really bad, when you do dungeons, and play against different bosses with different abilities, they have this same orb mechanic that is on every single boss, they spawn in and just remember the order of when they spawn and you win. Everything is a bullet sponge, nothing is interesting and its EXTREMELY, boring...  The campaign is awful, I can't tell you what even happens in the story because shooting things was more interesting than trying to understand the god awful story of doing the same 4-5 objectives throughout the entire 20-25 hours of gameplay. Its fun with friends though so you can get distracted, and its good that the social aspect makes the game a lot more enjoyable, the game is insane when you get over 5 teammates on 1 objective and insanely fun.  Overall, this game is free, it will die out, because of how boring it is, they'll end up revamping the entire campaign in a year, and it will go through the same struggles Warframe had to go through. please keep your wallet in your pocket, cause every corner of this game is trying to make you cough up your cash just so you can have a shortcut towards ""the content it offers.""

Essentially, playing for free is an exercise in frustration.  In my honest opinion, you should stop playing and uninstall the game after completing the main story campaign. The First Descendant is designed with only vertical progression and no horizontal progression, meaning the post-campaign gameplay becomes increasingly painful.

The first descendant,Bradneym01,"The first Descendant borrows several systems from other successful games but doesn't manage to pull them of in the same way as those other games. The filed zones server as nothing more then a way to move from point A to point B to interact with an item to start a new mission. The zones are empty and lifeless. If you aren't playing with a group and the 3 other people that can be in the zone at the same time as you are not dong the same mission as you, you are stuck playing by yourself as only 4 players can be in a given zone at the same time.  Almost every boss fight during the story shares the same stalling mechanic that if not done correctly or players aren't geared enough become impossible to get through. Several bosses also have timers involved in them that feel to short and cause more failures then actually getting party wiped.  The micro transaction structure in the game is reminiscent of Warframe where you are paying for the convenience of skipping a grind or speeding up a craft time but ultimately are not required to be purchased to get all of the characters or weapons in the game.  After clearing the games lack lacklustre story you are greeted with hard mode. Hard mode serves as nothing more then an excuse to go back to the open zones to get new gear. With the way hard mode is designed though each zone has a set item that is all but guaranteed to drop after very few enemy kills. So while i appreciate cutting down on farm time, i found myself fully geared at lv 100 in less then 10 minutes and an inventory filled with top quality items. At that point the rarity almost feels like a lie and almost diminishes the perceived value of the rarity.  After gearing you can take on the hard mode boss fights which server as nothing more then another source of getting character and weapon drops. The fights aren't all that enjoyable and become repetitive very quickly with them taking part in almost identical arenas with little to no variation.  After getting your new gear there is little to nothing more to do with it. I can understand a new launch game not having a lot of endgame content but realistically this game has no endgame content at all to speak of. Again another comparison to Warframe here as this game draws so heavily from it. Warframe at least has endless missions you can take your new gear into to really push yourself on. With The First descendant you just have the bosses you end up farming as actual content.  I would like to see what end game content this game adds in the future but as of now i see no reason to continue playing the game after the story (if you actually enjoy the story that is) as the gearing feels pointless and un needed and un fulfilling after a certain point.",Not Recommended,2024.07.09,27.5

The first descendant,Paul Caruso,"i'm writing this review in the middle of a defense mission because that's kind of the state of the game right now and my experience as a new player  my issues aren't with the RNG mechanics at all, i get that f2p games gotta make their money, i don't have a particular ax to grind with nexon at all, my problem isn't with the game in the slightest, i actually had a lot of fun with it until i've reached the point that i've had right now.  my experience as a new player has been this:  there isn't one.  playing the first descendant as a new player is the equivalent of your parent or older sibling or friend beating a level in a video game for you, but you haven't asked them to.  operations, the missions, wave defenses, raids, etc, are absolutely flooded with high level players farming the game that deprive of it any type of fun or pleasure or meaning.  when I say I am writing this in the middle of a defense mission, I mean that two ultimate characters are killing every single enemy that spawns with their abilities as they spawn. i don't even have a chance to attack anyone or even grind my own dailies or weeklies. this has been my experience more times than not. the only time that i get to have fun is when i'm matched up with players of a similar level, which the game doesn't offer the opportunity to choose.  my first operation mission i was matched up with two higher level players, two bunnies, so two descendants whose abilities are DOT AEO attacks around them that basically nuked everyone and we walked through the dungeon. my first boss fight was similar.  earlier i tried a boss raid for the second time, hoping that it would be different, and a player killed the boss in a single hit this time.  i am 8 hours into the game and both of my descendants are almost maxed despite the fact i am only two worlds into the story.  i have been power leveled without my consent.  this game is unplayable because it is being played by people who have been playing it since day 1 and there's no opportunity for anyone else to play it.  on top of that, there isn't even a sense of community. no one is talking to each other. no one greets each other in missions, not even a ""gg"" when it's over if you've been playing with someone approximate to your level. there is at least squad chat, so it's possible. people just choose not to.",Not Recommended,2024.09.09,7.9

Lo and behold season 1 is here and it just feels like chores on top of chores just for the chance to do???.... you guessed it!! more chores. Do puzzles (multiple of them which are just copy a shooter game!) to have a chance to move forward or get 1 shotted, and what awaits you are more crappy puzzles that you have to do just to chip away at the ""new bosses'"" shields just to finally do actual damage to them... but wait! you have to do this maybe a couple times only if your weapons are good enough; mine are ok and I only get to do the final mechanics twice; you could be stuck doing it many times. Welcome to Invasions!  Nothing they added out-weights the lows of this first season and I don't look forward to any upcoming seasons. I've played my fair share of Korean games. From Lost Ark to Gunbound to all the way down to Maple Story and I underestand that it is a different culture, but man! Every time a NEW Korean game pops up and I try to give it a fair try we just don't click and it never gets better. Maybe not worse, but just not better.  Good booty skins tho!

The first descendant,Pocahawtness,"A sort of cross between Warframe and Destiny II with a dash of Borderlands and even Tera, this is a good fun shooter.  It's a bit CPU heavy and glitchy but otherwise excellent. Nice and easy to pick up although you can't sail through the main quest without some practice and study! ( Mainly because you need to build the character and weapons).  The game is not at all pay-to-win, like some people have been saying. It's farming intensive, but you can sidestep it with cash if you are really daft, but spending money is not at all forced on you. There is no need to spend anything, but if you don't like farming or spending then this is not the game for you!!  Content wise, the game is a little limited at the moment. The point of the game is really to obtain all the characters. They require a lot of farming, and once you have them, you spend ages getting mods for them and so on. In fact, Getting them is perhaps the most difficult part (Which makes you wonder why people would buy them, since they are effectively just paying to not play the game).  When you get a new character, it is not necessary to start playing the lowest level areas, which is almost a shame. Your guns and mods are still levelled so you are still a powerful character even if level 1.  Now the bad news.  All the time the player base complain about the game. This has led the devs in completely the wrong direction. With the release of Season 1 its clear the Devs are taking the game more in the direction of Warframe than Destiny 2. They have modified all the main missions and removed anything that caused a delay - so the accent is on the speed-runner.  The game is currently dominated by a single character - Bunny - and no other character can keep up. Bunny kills everything instantly and moves faster than any other character. With Season 1, entire dungeons have been created for Bunny and other characters need not apply.  The game philosophy seems to be to make money on characters that are sold in the shop and with each release they introduce a new one that is insanely more powerful than the last. The game is way, way too easy and yet they make it easier with each step.  It's a huge shame. The game had a lot of potential, but it's all wasted. Nexon clearly want to keep the speed-runners happy. Oh well, sorry, Nexon, but I have to change my review to thumbs down.",Not Recommended,2024.07.08,652.3

The first descendant,LD | Rum,"Game was cool in the beginning. Needed a break from Warframe, a game that i have about 2k hours in between PC and console. Game shares alot of similarities with Warframe which made getting into the game very easy. After almost 100 hours though, i think im done.  Want to start with the good things. Gunplay feels good. The have a nice pop and there is a decent variety to choose from. Mobility is great. The grappling hook adds to the speed of the game and feels good zipping through different cliffs and corners. There is an abundance of loot to grind and challenging boss fights with the Collossi (however you spell it). The Descendants provide a nice variety in playstyles and help the gameplay feel fresh.  Everything else is ass though.  The monetization is crazy. Nexxon prices their items in a way where you have to pay extra in real world currency to buy the item. This leads to you paying almost double in real world currency to be able to buy that item you see in the shop. Now TBF, you can craft everything in the store and the game even tells you where to get everything. HOWEVER, the grind goes from ""oh this aint so bad"" to ""wtf am i doin in this game?"". Those percentages are a lie im sure. Also, there is no trading system (yet) so its not like you can repurpose extra items for premium currency to buy these items either. Coloring your Descendant is a consumable item smh.  The story....omg.....is terrible. It was a chore finishing the campaign. Boring campaigns aren't new in looters but this game in particular man.....sheesh....felt like a job completing it. Once i hit endgame it did get better but then we get to the last issue, the leveling.  Leveling takes a long time. Everyone says ""oh do this farm"" or do that but in my testing they dont vary greatly in time spent. With a dedicated team setup you can go from 1 to max in about an hour. At first this doesn't seem too bad, until you realize that to do the hardest content you need to apply multiple catalysts and an energy activator to your Descendant. Once you apply a catalyst, you have to go from level 1 again. It's a similar system to Warframe except the time spent is way higher. The catalysts and activator grind takes a bit of time too. Overall, to prep a Descendant for all the hardest content will take several hours of dedicated grind with a meta grind setup. Without it, it will take longer. Not like the game gives you chances to obtain these items through world events or that battle pass they want you to buy either.  If you play games like Warframe or Destiny, do yourself a favor and just stay where you are. You aren't missing anything over here. Ultimate Bunny is nice, sure, but would you really want to play an inferior looter just to be able to see some ass jiggle physics? I'm open to revise this review down the line when changes are made.

The first descendant,TennoKai,"This Nexon game exemplifies the worst of microtransactions and psychological tactics aimed at coaxing players into spending money. It employs excessively long timers on crafting materials, enticing users to bypass these waits with real cash, essentially eliminating the timers. This practice is highly exploitative.  The game involves a long and exhausting grind for RNG materials, crucial for crafting special time-gated items, weapons, and characters. This grind can be circumvented by spending money, presenting a significant barrier to players who want to enjoy the game and build their characters. No one wants to wait while they're having fun, right? That's because they purposely designed it this way. What's a few bucks to get that gun? What about a few more to get that ascension material? How about another? The game is designed to frustrate players into paying for progress, with tactics that feel manipulative. Comparable games, like Destiny, Outriders, and Remnant 2, offer similar mechanics without these paywalls or time-gated features.  Additionally, the game's structure caters to addictive tendencies with short missions, consistent game play, and the lure of valuable loot drops.

The first descendant,Touching Grass,"The First Descendant, a game with potential, ultimately disappoints due to a myriad of flaws that overshadow its few strengths. The hype surrounding its release set high expectations, but the reality is a frustrating experience marred by poor execution and lackluster elements.  While the gameplay, initially promising, becomes repetitive and monotonous quickly. The combat system lacks depth, relying on basic machinery that weakens after a few hours. Enemies are uninspired and offer no challenge, making for a heavy experience that feels more like drudgery than adventure. Attempts to diversify the game, such as different mission types, fail to add meaningful variety to the gameplay. Instead, players are plunged into fetch quests and mindless battles that offer little satisfaction or reward.  Also, the game suffers from serious technical issues. From minor annoyances to game-breaking problems, mistakes and mistakes abound. Frame rate drops and crashes repeatedly, upsetting the game and testing the patience of even the most dedicated players. Graphic fidelity is inconsistent, with some areas looking polished, while others look unfinished and lack luster. These technical glitches point to a rushed development process, with the game feeling more like an early access title than a polished release.  In terms of development, The First Descendant falls into the pitfalls of many modern games, relying heavily on gimmicks. The in-game economy is skewed to encourage players to spend real money to get to or get things they want. This pay-to-win approach is particularly disappointing in a game that already struggles to retain players with its core mechanics. It creates a distinction between players willing to spend and those willing to improve organically, undermining any sense of fair play or accomplishment.  The most important aspect of any science fiction game is that the world room is vague and lifeless. The environment, although visually stunning at times, is empty and devoid of meaningful interaction. The NPCs are stable and function as little more than quest dispensers.  In conclusion, The First Descendant is a missed opportunity. Its uninspired story, repetitive gameplay, technical issues, disappointing multiplayer, and predatory microtransactions combine to create an experience that is more frustrating than enjoyable. While it has moments of potential, they are overshadowed by its many shortcomings. Fans of the genre would be better served looking elsewhere for their next adventure.",Not Recommended,2024.07.03,5.7

Right now, I feel like rushing into the game not because the game feels great, but because it shoves so much time limited stuff on my face that I feel obligated to do stuff. I don't want any of that pressure, I already have a job and life to care about.  There is too much bad monetization and excessive grind right now, and it relies too much in FOMO (i.e.: battle passes). At the same time, this game inherits a lot of mechanics from Warframe, but none of the good aspects related to being more casual friendly (better monetization, less FOMO). The battle pass didn't feel like it's worth its value. What I receive back as a player in Warframe is much higher for the same amount of money as the battle pass in First Descendant, and they need to rework this. It has to feel more rewarding.  There is a lot of good stuff in this game, and potential, but right now, as it is, I can't recommend it for people who, like me, want to play it in a casual way, without having to worry about deadlines, FOMO and all that.

On another note, they could really use some hard stat requirements for the matchmaking past a certain point to improve chances of completing content available with it.

UI has input lag everywhere - Esc button, inventory, marking stuff for junk (and you WILL have to do it since it's a part of gameplay - to clean up a loot), map button - all have annoying input lag, if you are using keyboard\mouse. But, if you connect a gamepad - there's no input lags at all. That's called a pretty bad coding - they couldn't put it in a right place from gamepad controls to keyboard\mouse controls. When you speak to any NPC in Towns or in maps, for quests, you should move the mouse cursor from the very left screen side to the hard right screen side to push the dialogue button. Cause it's in the very left screen side by default. That's stupid. They just released the game ""as is"". Like ""what can go wrong, right? People won't notice all this stuff anyway"".

You are NOT allowed to change ANY gear cosmetics color for free or grind it. No. Pay for that or keep running with the rest of the same Bunny types in lobby\maps\towns etc.  No one, in pre-production, have ever tested the title, on keyboard\mouse, i believe. Or, those, who have, know nothing about how games are created. Feels like Alpha or Early Beta.  Glad it's free.",Not Recommended,2024.07.06,39.7

The first descendant,Concerned Black Father,"I get the feeling that most of the positive reviews are just people hyping the game up as a part of their coom crusade, which is understandable. The designs of all the human characters make them very physically attractive, which is nice to see in the midst of the purposeful uglification of people, especially women, in modern gaming. However, this is not enough for me to recommend this game because the actual game part is dreadfully boring.  The movement, gunplay, bosses, quests, everything is just so bland and lacks any impact. I kept playing thinking that maybe I would find that cool weapon type or mission to make things click, but that moment never came. Every boss so far is just a damage sponge with multiple invulnerability phases that range from somewhat annoying to ""can I get the designer's home address?"". Warframe has a whole flippidy dip whip and nay nay system to make getting around dynamic, but all you get here is a grappling hook that barely speeds you up and kills all your momentum the moment it disconnects from a surface. Every weapon lacks any punch or weight whatsoever. They all feel like some sci-fi nerf gun. Character skills can be useful but they run out so fast and energy to use them can be hard to come by if your unlucky so they cant be relied on. It really just feels like a worse version of both Destiny and Warframe smashed together into some horrific abomination badly hidden behind some hot anime girls.  The craziest thing about this release imo is the fact that some people haven't even received the fake money they paid for to get their waifu skins yet. The whole point of this game is to extract money from lonely, horny nerds with too much extra cash and they cant even get that right at launch. Nexon has been taking people's money through micro transactions for 30 years and they somehow forgor when this came out.

The first descendant,Capuno,"At the current state it's a lower quality Warframe. It has some cool concepts but seems to be a bit of a crash grab with no soul. The movement is very clumsy, you always feel like your character could do more. The grappling hook can't reach more than a couple of meters, and you are as fast just walking, so it's only used on ledges where you can't jump. You can also shoot the grappling hook when it's not locked in, wasting time. It just feels less fun to move around. Being a Korean company it could have been a sick thing to do add mobility difficulty like GunZ The Duel, because the movement in Warframe is supposed to be easy, it would have been a very cool change. Alas they decided to just remove movement completely and use some cheap mechanics. Also not sure what the point is on mining the data on the player computer.

The first descendant,Splashbang,"As per usual, NEXON doesn't hold back when it comes to overmonetizing their games and overpricing their currencies and cash shops. The First Ascendant is no exception..  Literally every aspect of the game has been monetized, including progression.  The premium currency is so overpriced that this game will end up on life support in a couple of months at best.  While the game play is fun and mostly fluid, there's really nothing unique here. It borrows most of it's game play loops from games like Warframe, Destiny 2 and Anthem.  However, where the two latter games NEXON borrows from are free of most monetizations, NEXON clamps down hard on it, and monetize absolutely everything, from customization (One dye per slot, and they are costly) to progression.  There's also an emphasis on FOMO in this game when it comes to skins and such.  You literally cannot play this game at an efficient level without continuously pumping money into it, which is why this game will not last long.  NEXON need to stop pretending as if overpriced cash shops and overmonetization in their games will help the developers behind their games in any way. It doesn't. These overmonetization schemes and over the top cash shop prices and currency prices are detrimental to any game, which is also why NEXON tend to shut down their games after 3-6 months, because they can't sustain them with cash whales alone.  If this game is to survive long term, NEXON need to come off their high horse. They need to stop thinking short term and start thinking long term. They need to stop overmonetize and overprice everything. They need to come down on their monetization, currency prices and in-game cash shop prices.  Until they do, i cannot with a clear concience recommend this game.

The first descendant,LordKaname3,"Game lacks endgame content. Huge grindy system for amazing characters with each of their own cool abilities. However nowhere to really use em since endgame consists of repeat runs of the old bosses and dungeons you have already done.  Bosses would be fun but there are currently too many unavoidable attacks with tracking like no other and repeat boss mechanics for every boss. For example, the floating orbs that you have to take down before dealing damage to the boss which sometimes interchange on which orb you can and cant shoot. And this mechanic persists for a majority of bosses in this game. They need to change it up a bit, keep it entertaining  Outside character specific quests like bunny and freyna. Each character seems replaceable in the narrative with very little going on outside of what the player sees. Very difficult to really feel for your character when what they fight for and why isn't really explained or shown to you.  The campaign was however fun for me. It was fun to explore the new maps that the game introduces. It was fun to run around and shoot at the various mobs that the game threw at me. The story was actually interesting, except the character you controlled had little to no input into the story.

The first descendant,Rufalicious,"After nearly 600 hrs into the game, I finally had to stop playing. The gameplay is too repetitive. There isn't any engaging end-game content. Every time they do add new content, it's frustrating and not fun to play. There are so many bugs that you just get used to them and accept them as part of the gameplay, but it's incredibly frustrating. They add terrible mechanics with a ton of bugs just to turn around and ""fix"" some of them the following week, and then expect the players to be happy they made changes when, in reality, they still released half-finished, buggy content.  The in-game purchases are completely over-priced. They only release hyper-sexual female character content, which I have no problem with, except that they never release the same for male characters. When questioned about it, the Devs said that the male character skins don't sell... except how would they know that since they never released similar male skins...? When they do release male skins, they're joke skins. They're clearly catering to only one aspect of their playerbase while ignoring everyone else. Without engaging content, at this point, the game boils down to running around with your favorite character, which I would be totally fine with actually, except they don't offer a diverse enough selection of characters to choose from for me to enjoy.  Do not get me started on the horrible Google AI translations. It's often impossible to understand what the skills are doing because the explanation is translated so badly.  The character balance is completely wack. When I last played, Freyna was dominating everything with her one-click skill that spreads everywhere. There was no point is using other characters. I picked Ajax as my starting character and loved his playstyle as a heavier, tank build. But his tanking abilities just don't work. His shields are weak. They don't even block many of the boss abilities. The enemies can walk right through the shield. There's zero reason for any teammates to even bother standing behind the shield. And there's no aggo mechanics. Basically, there's just no point in playing as any character other than the one they're trying to sell at the moment because they overpowered them to convince you to pay-to-play.  Honestly, I could continue to go on about why I don't recommend this game, but I've already given enough of my time to this game and writing this review is reminding me of the frustrations I had playing it.

If you want to see semi or full naked sexy bodies of women, then better live life.  In general, this is one big hodgepodge of generic assets from the unreal engine store, which does not have its own expressive look or any good quality except for the horny costumes of female characters. By the way, as in any Korean game, they are vulgar in the first place, and then clumsy, boring and primitive. Are they not suitable for the setting? Of course, because there is simply no setting here, it is a set of sci-fi assets.  The game menus? They are as cheap as possible and are taken from other Korean grind games. Just static pictures, with identical windows, without beautiful animations or attempts at aesthetics. It's garbage  The animations are clumsy, their gluing and changing is either primitive, not highlighting the characters, or just ragged, like some character movements. The animation of the hook hitting the air is a separate shame. The animation of the skills is extremely poor and pathetic.  Shooting? I didn't expect any revelations, but there's not even any feeling of hits or at least something. It's a shame. There is no feeling of skills here. Did you get hit by a grenade of a different color? Wow, it feels like you've been hit by a blizzard or electricity, just no difference.  The plot of the game, like the setting, does not catch on from the first minutes, it is generic. The lines seem to be taken from the AI promt. It's as depressing as possible, even for this genre.  Bugs? There are many of them. They're even on a prologue mission. At first, I had to restart the mission, as the quest just wasn't being completed. And then the weapon models disappeared, and the character fired from crooked empty hands.  AI is as dumb as possible, spawn opponents out of thin air, allied dummies on the map do not react. And the AI of the opponents is just squalor.

The first descendant,Voidkravter,"sexy woman, handsome men. thats pretty much it. Well, almost.  First the bad, after clearing the story the only thing you will be doing is getting your meta character out, pray you have a chase item so there is a point in playing this game, keep resetting your level to get stronger and literally run circles all day every day.  the story is pretty boring, gameplay usually repetetive. every support role gets completely irrelevanted by the fact that the 2 meta characters can clear all content pretty much solo by running circles around enemies. And while being boring it is completely necessary, because if you would grind all those mats without meta characters you would quite possibly loose your mind.  And with mats i primarily mean the aqcuisition mechanic of new weapons and battlesuits to play. TFDs idea is to put them into gacha items (of course), BUT those things you gonna open are completely f2p. If you pull a blueprint you like, you farm the mats and wait for those thingies to finish building. That all seems largely fine to me so far, if you have patience.  The problem is the gameplay loop for the gacha. It is (in the endgame) a 20 sek go interact with things in a 15m wide circle and kill one miniboss, with a one minute cooldown. Take the gacha things to a 30sek combat encounter which takes one of four resources which you get from a roughly 60sek combat encounter. It gets boring fast.  But there is also some good, the warframe-esque module system of upgrades is kinda fun to customize your gameplay through. Availability of short and long form content in one package is good as well. Sadly dungeons and the group bosses have terrible efficiency to grind new stuff. Another great thing is the gunplay, it feels snappy and the modules really make a difference. Also the difference in gameplay between characters is refreshing.  The verdict is, its a technically good game if you dont care much about story, just plaqued by a terrible gameplay loop. And thus i cannot really recommend it as it is now. Except of course you like that kind of gameplay. It could be pretty good in a year or so though, if they manage to make the gameplay loop more interesting.",Not Recommended,2024.09.10,109.2

But hey, I can live without a narrative in a grind game.  The downfall is the monetization. Not only is it overpriced, it's impact on the game is horrendous. The drop rates are bad, the material grind is bad, everything is just layers of RNG on top of RNG. It takes all the F2P systems from Warframe and makes it A TON worse. The percentages are lower, it's harder to boost them, it takes away choosing the result of amorphous material from everything the party opens, there's no trading, no pitty system, not only are research times long they also have limited slots....

The first descendant,Prinny,"For any ""I ain't reading all that viewers"": If you never played Warframe or Destiny 2 go play those instead, if you played both and came here then this game is offers nothing better at its peak that even the worst parts of Warframe and Destiny combined will give you. However if you just want to play a looter shooter play but keep your expectations low the only true quality is the bare basics of any game it kills time.  My Thoughts: Respectfully, there is nothing positive to say about this game, from stiff boring animation and movement to bland guns, generic bosses, and the basic environments you expect from the PS3 and Xbox 360 eras. In my opinion, the lack of personality or actual style in the game is the biggest pain in this game, where the only memorable thing is that the chicks are hot. I can't really see anything mentioned above getting better, but in this case, I'll gladly be wrong for the better of the game. I still hope it can receive quality of life, and when new content is added, it will be unique or just decent in general because, with the core, the game won't just die off and can still be fun, but if it ends as bland as Borderlands 3 endgame, then there is nothing keeping anyone around.

The first descendant,Feline Entity,"Went into this game ignoring all reviews. Played through nearly all of the ""Normal"" Difficulty, and had fun for a bit, trying to get to the point where I could farm for the Turret character. But sadly I was hit with the reality:  Materials required for the character are locked behind randomly placed secret chests, which can only opened with a rare item that doesn't drop in any specific place, so you can't really deliberately farm for them directly, you just get them randomly. And even if you gt a few and figure out how to find the chests, the minigame you have to play can easily make you waste those rare items as you screw up the minigame, leaving you with loads of wasted time. Amazing design. Hope you don't have any kind of disability that makes this reaction based mechanic entirely impossible to you.  The later missions give enemies modifiers. This is in itself fine, but it gets unmanagable and very unfun as over half the enemies get a combination of a unbreakable aura shield that forced you into close quarters, MP sucking enemies that drain you entire skill energy, just to follow up with invincible enemies that can only be hurt by skills or weakpoint shots, the former which you now can't use because the MP suckers just removed all your energy. Wanted to use the energy before its gone? You can't, while you are being sapped it just blocks all your skill use. Because why would you wanna use the abilities that make your character unique?  All of this isn't necessarily hard content, but it turns into very annoying gameplay that revolves around rolling in and out of enemy effects and shooting at them and less using your cool abilities. All of this makes me not wanna grind for the character I was originally set out for anymore. I like grinding, but I don't like the annoying constant dance the enemies end up forcing you into, just to have no feeling of progress. And if I have to do that dance, will the character that summons immobile turrets even function in that environment? I'm not sticking around to find out.  The ""infiltration"" mission is strange as hell, having you activate towers over the map, then go to an outpost and if you aren't detected destroying depots, you get extra rewards. In a public mission. On an outpost with no hiding spots. Where anyone can come in and just destroy the depots easily without caring about the infiltration bonus. Who designed this?  Apparently people complained about the world feeling dead, so patrols were added that are inconsequential and don't add anything. Given the Warframe influence, I do not care about the world ""feeling dead"", because most of the gameplay doesn't exist in the open world, it's in instances where people endlessly farm for a mission reward drop they want. That's fine, and I still appreciate the open world part for the story as you randomly encounter help from other players instead of a more rigid mission structure. Issues about ""world feel"" are entirely secondary to the actual issue of annoying gameplay I mentioned earlier.  Lastly the UX design is horrid. There are 3 different pause menus. When you go to the character select screen you have to press an extra button to show the actual list of characters (the main reason you go to that screen in the first place), and then ANOTHER button to get options around that character. This could all be one. It feels like a jungle clicking through menus to find out what item can be found where, even though they did so well letting you click an item in the research menu to show you the mission. And while you can teleport from there to the nearest entry point, it doesn't actually let you way mark the mission until you have teleported there first. Why?  Missions show you their drops on the map screen, but if you actually wanna know what these drops actually do beyond their name, you have to go all the way to the mission and interact with the terminal to read through the drop descriptions. Another ""why?"".  Minibosses during operations boil down to the same mechanic of ""kill a health bar, kill orbs so the boss stops being invincible, repeat until dead"". The game's inability to let you actually damage enemies in a fun way stems from its obsession of making everything invincible just so you don't blaze through it too fast. That invincibility crutch is one of the main reasons fighting enemies becomes more of a chore than what it should be, a fun grind activity.  Oh, and don't bother playing the game on an HDD. You will have a laggy mess as the game struggles to load in textures and LODs, randomly freezing the game seconds at a time, Your team will have started the mission 20 seconds before you so you can play catch up as you run through unloaded terrain, because the loading times are now 10x what they would be on an SSD.  Overall I really wanted to like this game, and it looked promising at the start. But in the end it just became a very frustrating mess. Apart from gameplay, Story is fairly uninteresting, making me wanna skip most dialogue as they use a lot of words to say nothing. MTX are pretty meh, the cosmetics look fairly fun and not too ridiculous, but a lot of the other stuff basically give you resources so you don't have to play the game so much. Dark patterns pretty much emerge immediately if you try to buy a character you are interested in (potentially removing loads of grind and therefore gameplay), as the packs are just too short of letting you buy a character, so you have to fork over extra cash.  Not Recommended. Either go back to Warframe despite its fairly bad onboarding, or try out Zenless Zone Zero if you want a action filled grind with fun characters.  Edit: I nearly forgot to mention, player collision boxes are huge, so you will constantly run into other players, coming to a standstill during fights. Which is especially fun when you play Bunny, a character that needs to move constantly to get the most out of her. You don""t even ""slide"" off the characters, you just go full stop until you find a direction that side steps them.",Not Recommended,2024.07.11,39.5

I will give credit where credit is due, the art direction of this game is top notch and I hope everyone responsible for the look and feel of this game can find success away from Nexon.  Nexon does not care about their playerbase, at all. They are essentially the new Daybreak (If you know, you know).  Nexon is notorious for releasing cash grabs and then shutting them down. Seriously, goto their wiki and just look at the wall of IPs they've pulled the plug on. They go from cash grab to cash grab and don't stay loyal to anything. Soon as this game shows a fraction of loss of playerbase they will pull the plug on this one too.  Now for the game itself...  The game is free to play sure, but if you want full access to the game and features you need to pay 300 to 600 credits. Its a shame that the shop only gives you 2 options 250 or 580, damn just short. But that's Nexon for you. Lets make the game free to play with the slowest xp grind imaginable and give those who pay for the game xp boost and instant unlocks. This game is the very definition of pay to skip. That should not exist. Destiny with a Battle Pass?  More like a hard pass...  The enemies are too easy, anyone can bullhorn their way through the game with little to no difficulty.

I'm a big Destiny player, I'm also positive Nexon made this with the intention of getting some players from that community based on the fact that there's multiple core concepts in the opening cinematic that seem pretty closely lifted from Destiny. I only played the intro mission and dipped when I was bombarded with all the alerts and icons in Albion (Social area), feels really overwhelming for a new player. What really killed my interest for the most part was the gameplay during the first 30 minutes. Got access to all the abilities and multiple weapon types, it all feels like there's no impact, floaty almost. Abilities are lackluster to put it bluntly, the effects are pretty tame and the movement which looked really cool in trailers just isn't, the grapple hook is janky, feels bad to use. We're in an age where games (especially free to play) have to be worth your time to invest in, I don't see any magic here, just a game that's copying better, more complete products.

The first descendant,ArdentSlacker,"This is a very pretty game. It is a... mostly polished experience, though the balance is a bit off if you're stuck solo defending an objective. There's no time for the shields to recharge, so unless you have a power that can watch your flank for you, that can be unpleasant.  The progression system is Warframe... but surprisingly, less grindy. Warframe, If I want to earn a new frame, I'm going to be repeating content for a while to get the parts I need. Here, at least for some of it, it's pretty straightforward. You can look up what you need and where to get it from the ""research"" NPC... which isn't in any way research, it's just construction.  The modules for characters and weapons has an auto option, which saves time and math, but may leave things out for no obvious reason. I had the capacity to throw on an elemental damage resist, and no reason not to add it... and no alternative options. Strange.  There's also a character equipment system I'd say fills the role of armor. Reactor and subsystems. Unfortunately, while the reactor will have 2 synergy types, the reactor doesn't snap to a specific character. If you swap characters, you'll keep the equipment, but have to assign character modules separately. This feels like it was intended to have some option to keep maximum benefit for a character, but doesn't.  Combat... works. It's not great, and since in-combat MP management is through random pickups (unless you luck onto some gear that gives you regeneration).... you're going to have to get in close to pick up the HP and MP or be stuck standing back without options. And heaven help you if you miss with a power.  I've played worse. Mechanically, there's nothing wrong here... they've made Warframe, but a hero shooter. Only... there's no mention of how switching characters... works. There's no explanation for anything going on. Instead of tell or show, it's really not doing either. The MacGuffin du jour is an ""Ironheart"". Which, if you collect them like dragon balls, can restore the dimensional barrier. How do we know this? No idea. Where are they from? No idea.  I watched the big bad and his chief scientist use the Ironheart to... kill some of their own guys and one ended up wearing hulkbuster armor. And the big bad knew his name, gave command to lead the vanguard... and... I don't know what happened or why we're meant to care.  The player has a Guide that's sus as heck, and the human commander is vocal about it, but A) has no other leads, B) cannot clearly explain why it's such an obvious infosec issue to have the magic soldiers taking orders from an imaginary character.  And... ugh. There's so many little terrible bits of writing... and the hell of it is that the acting is incredible. The plot's terrible, badly presented, and I don't think anybody was allowed to edit the writing. So there's these 3D character models with fantastic facial features, good art direction, great physical acting, and the voice cast is delivering this nonsense fantastically. But it's drivel.  I'll admit, I never made it terribly far into Warframe, but I have gone back to it a couple times over the years, just to see what else they've added (and then I don't get to see any of it because I never get enough unlocked to actually do any new content).

You'll understand more if you go in and check it out. It's free, so the only thing you have to lose really is just time. I'll likely update this review the more I play.  [PROS] -Free to Play. -A decent time waster -Public or private matching making. -Cross-platform between all platforms! -Can be played Solo or in a party of up to 4. -Easy to follow of going from Point A to Point B for quests. -If you enjoy Destiny and Warframe, you'd like this as well. -Runs well, even for harder that is below the recommended. -The voice acting is pretty, at least pleasant to listen to anyways. -Free to play model doesn't make you feel like you are locked out of stuff. -Has a decent story tutorial that sets the tone for the rest of the game basically.   [CONS] -Overpriced shop skins. -Battle Pass that also expires. WHY!? -Character specific quests. I DON'T care for them really. -Some network disturbances now and then (likely cause the game is new). -No in-depth character customization.

It looks nice and the gunplay is good enough that it kept me going to the end of the story quests but now I'm staring down the barrel of the grind phase I just have no appetite for it. The weapons are quite same-y, and although there are quite a few different descendant powers most of them just feel like farting in the wind. For a game that expects you to spend hundreds of hours grinding for loot it fails at the first step for me - being satisfying to play over and over again.  Maybe it will grow and deepen like Warframe did, but I don't see any of the charm and uniqueness that Warframe (or even Destiny I think) had even in the early days. The story can pretty much be summarised as ""bad guy explains exactly what they're going to do -> all our expert advisers tell us that's impossible and can't be done -> bad guy does it as stated"" rinse and repeat. Playing through it with a couple of friends multiple times we found ourselves kind of wondering why we're helping these idiots. For one of the big bads, defecting honestly seemed like a pretty good option if it had been available. Can't say I found myself getting swept along in the narrative, very quickly just became something I had to get through to unlock all the regions. Considering how annoying most of the people you meet are as well, including a couple of characters clearly set up as future Descendant releases, I'm not exactly excited by future updates either. Unless there's an option to immediately yeet her into the sun I'm not sure I'm going to enjoy folks like Luna very much.  It's a game I can see myself coming back to occasionally for some low stress shooting when I have one of those days staring at my Steam library not feeling like anything in particular, but doesn't appeal for the long haul.

Some might like it, but for me I never got along with the Modsystem in Warframe so thats that. Furthermore the game is monetized very aggressevly. You can open up the ingame shop were you can unlock other descendents and just get bombarded by 20 different bundles which are pretty pricey. now I don´t mind them trying to make money, since this game is Free-to-Play but this is a bit too much. As for the story its there, would be the kindest way to put it. If this game was atleast bad enough to make fun of it would make the game atleast a bit more interesting, but as it stands now its just a game that gets boring really fast and I feel like boring games are worse than bad games cause atleast a bad game can be funny.

You think this Developer could have been less obvious with design of the game. Well after another 45 hours playing this game and completing the Campaign I have to say its a dud. There's realy nothing to do after finishing the campaign apart from rinsing and repeating on hard difficulty. The grind is as bad as Warframe.

The first descendant,Zerkonium,"These things may change, as the game gets updates and patches, but as of right now, these are my first impressions, in my personal experience:  Extremely poor optimization and performance even on low 1080p with a medium card and processor (2070 super and ryzen 7 3700x). Can barely reach 70 -80 frames in most areas even with Nvidia boost. Textures constantly flicker and have issues stabilizing. Loading screens often will just go black and not work. Game stutters frequently, enough to take away from the game play. I get blurry gameplay most of the time and it constantly tells me its installing shaders. I dont know how to fix this and I cant find online as to why this happens.  Gameplay wise, the new player experience is not terrible per se, but the difficulty increases at a rate which I (and apparently others) cannot keep up with. The missions go from barebones easy difficulty to borderline terrifyingly difficult to how much you lose health, and adjusting my descendant modules for def and resist doesnt seem to help. I have que'd for the fourth ""void intercept"" (these are pretty much story boss battles) over fifteen times and everyone can do no damage and just rage quits. Boggling why this is the case? In my opinion this needs an overhaul. if mechanically there is something I am missing, it also needs to be more apparent. I am matching my resist to the bosses attack (the game even recommends a certain amount) and i still instantly die. I match my guns to the bosses weakness (again, this is recommended in the que screen) and my guns do no damage.  The social hub is slow and far to spread out. It reminds me of destiny with how awful it is to explore around when you have zero movement and abilities. Only giving us two teleport points is not a good solution. Please allow us to move fast and access the hub at our own pace and not a slugs pace. If i want to move quickly between vendors there shouldnt be an artificial process slowing me down. Social hubs should be at the players leisure to how they wish to enjoy it.  The game has an excellent base and I see a lot of potential.

Tons of menus and pop ups, I just do what the big purple banner tells me to otherwise I have no clue navigating.

Pros: - Good looking looter shooter - Weapons feel good, enemies are fun to kill - Characters somewhat different and interesting  Cons: - Drop rates for Energy Activators and other end game progression items is too low - Vault mini game sucks and is mandatory for progression (need to farm Enzo or else you go crazy) - Repetitive mission designs and lack of alternative options to farm certain materials (there is so many farming options I don´t know why they didn´t spread material availability more out) - So many small timers where you wait for repetitive tasks. Half of my farm time was waiting around (1:20 min. to complete a level and then 10 sec. start timer and 30 sec. wait timer until instance restarts in solo mode. I don´t get it, just why??) - Bunny for farming is so braindead and powerful. If you want to maximize farming speed you will use her but her abilities makes you just run around and kill everything instead of ever using a weapon (except for bosses)  Overall .. I think its worth checking out and if you are looking for a looter shooter to get your hands on this is worth a shot, however I think they have not found a good way to make endgame farming diverse and interesting enough for me to keep going.

Ignore the idiots with 1 hour of playtime and negative reviews. They made the decision to hate the game before they ever tired it. I assumed it would be bad given that it's Nexon, but it's a pretty solid game so far. I cannot see myself stopping any time soon.  Microtransactions are VERY minimal and entirely optional. I was not expecting that!  Review edit below:  The game is very good, but frankly there's just a few hundred small issues that need fixed. Here's a handful:  1. We need to have damage meters for boss fights, showing us how much damage each player is doing, how much damage each player has taken, etc. Just allow us to see each other's stats - you've got them saved server side anyway. Stop trying to protect people, the game is actively being made worse from a raiding perspective by you trying to protect people. 2. No clan features at all. Effectively, no social features. Adding and joining friends lobbies is difficult beyond reason. Let our friends just join our parties by right clicking our name in social. 2.5: It should be much easier to add people as friends. 3. The ""Generic item name 7924"" names on items is just silly and no one's going to remember what those items are or what they do. Seems like a translation error half the time.

Speaking of the enemies, there are basically several types that never change mechanically only visually outside of the mega bosses, a.k.a. the giant guys. Speaking of the giant boss enemies, there is supposed to be a mechanic where you weaken them by shooting a weak spot and grapple onto them to deal bigger damage, but it's easier to just shoot them until they die. I only saw someone use that mechanic a single time. Visually the game looks pretty good, but not good enough to perform as terribly as it does. I mean c'mon guys it regularly dips below 60 FPS using a 5900x, RTX 3070, and 32 GB of RAM at 1080p WITH DLSS on and ray tracing off! Every weapon I have seen so far looked terrible, visually.

The story is bland and uneventful, the voice acting is terrible, and the missions are rinse and repeat with no variation. The worst part of the game, however, might be the bosses, most of which are, melt through the bosses first health bar, destroy 3 invulnerability spheres, then, do it again.  There is no originality at all. The game takes idea from both Warframe and Destiny, finds a way to more aggressively monetize them while increasing the grind, and then offers you little more in return other than the ability to unlock slightly more skimpy outfits.

The first descendant,Punnilingus,"I put ""no"" on recommend because I NEED the devs to see this.  First, the game is fantastic, tbh. It's laggy as heck, even with a ridiculous internet (which I have), but aside from the occasional glurp, it's phenomenal. I love, love, love Warframe and this is basically that, but unfortunately without sliding and acrobatics (please add).  But I cannot - WILL NOT - recommend this game until they fix the flippin' AMMO DROPS. Oh, my gurd.  FIX THE AMMO DROPS - THIS IS A LOOTER SHOOTER WHERE YOU WILL RUN OUT OF AMMO 3 MINUTES INTO A MISSION AND BE SCREWED  Once you fix this, I will change my review. I have two High-powered round weapons and they just don't get ammo drops. Not from the enemies and not from the resource boxes and not from the replenish bot.  And what's up with the replenish bot?? I use it, wait 5 seconds to use again and it says I can't get anymore, despite it not filling up my ammo. If ammo drops are going to be so scarce, the least you could do is have the replenish bot replenish ALL ammo in one go, or, make us do it for one weapon, wait for cooldown, swap to other weapon, replenish, rinse repeat.  But nope - I run around with 3 guns, 2 of which are constantly empty and one of which has a decent enough resupply but that I can still run out mid-mission and be totally screwed.  This is a completely borked design decision and it needs to be fixed. I will not recommend until you fix it. I just won't.  And honestly I don't know why the reviews are ""mixed"" because, really, aside from an overpriced shop, the game is f2p and it really is a lot of fun grinding, upgrading, dismantling, etc. It's an awesome game that needs some QoL things and additional tutorials for some of the other meta systems within the game, but the game really is good.",Not Recommended,2024.07.09,9.5

Another thing that might get boring is, it's always the same quests except for the bosses this really needs a change if you want to keep players engaged.  the boss areas could also be different to make the fights look cooler.

The first descendant,sarcasm83,"Overall, I have enjoyed the game for what it is. Attractive female characters, fun gunplay despite simple missions, I enjoy the grapplehook mechanics as well as having zoomies with Bunny and wrecking everything. There's also some part in me that enjoys grinding for some materials and eventually getting what I earned.  However there are too many blatantly disrespectful mechanics in this game that take the players for complete fools. The biggest one is the convenient Caliber pricing that you can only buy 250, but things cost 300 etc. Every package is more than you need for the lowest tier of items, but just shy of the bit more pricy things. That is such a slap in the face every time a developer does that. It's nothing else but psychological manipulation and a huge F U.  The other thing is the consumable paints that you pay 25 caliber for each time you use one unique paint. Never to be used again on another armor. It is not as broken as a few reviews say: You do NOT pay 125 caliber if you use the same paint in 5 different slots, you only pay 25 per unique paint item you use. If you buy one white paint for one slot and one red paint on one slot, you pay 50 and then can change the armor in any configuration you want coloring different parts red or white as long as you have at least one paint in it. But if you paint everything white then, you lose the red paint forever. Head skins (helmets) and body armors are however different and you need to pay the 25 for each if you use one paint. If you use a different color on every 5 armor slots and every 3 helmet slots, you will end up paying 200 caliber.  Add to that the skin you need to buy to use those paints on, as default appearances can't be painted, you will be paying a fair sum just for the basic customization.  Which, I admit, I did. But I fear if being invested in this game will make me buy more in the future or more than what I'd be comfortable with, as I'm not the most strong willed individual.  So with all of that said, I can't with good conscience recommend the game. Wanna play it safe to not fall into clear psychological monetization? Stay away. Have a strong will and know you won't pay more than you're comfortable? Go ahead!",Not Recommended,2024.07.09,336.9

A challenge? There are better mechanics out there to play upon other than just mass spawning minions and forcing your fight away from the bosses.

While it looks sick and has fairly nice sound design, it feels just....shallow? Flat? Stale? The general movement feels almost weightless but not in a good way. Somehow feeling both slow and clunky, but also way too responsive. Movements are instant with little to no weight behind them. Gun play is fine at best, uninspired at worst. Feeling more like you're playing airsoft rather than shooting big weapons.  The start of the game is just not interesting or fun. It drops you into a tutorial mission, give you a basic rundown of your movement and abilities. They almost certainly copied the story from other things, without actually knowing how to write something interesting on their own. They literally throw a huge enemy at you in the start saying ""Oh no! This is really bad! But it looks weaker than normal so we can take it!"" before telling you all these crazy mechanics like climbing onto the thing and ripping chunks out of it to weaken it. Meanwhile, I shot it a few times and it died with ease. Where was the challenge? Was it really that dangerous of an enemy?  This feels like another NEXON pump and dump game.

I like the fast paced gameplay and customization you can put towards your characters builds, whether it be resistances, skill augmentations, building up for skills, crit chances, etc etc there is a good amount of things you can choose. Game is beautiful, love the last region (snow) because, its snow.  Cons: Do you like a challenge in your game? If so this game is not for you. Anything even remotely difficult is nerfed into the ground to appease the smooth brain entitled gamers the developers have intentionally and explicitly said they wanted to attract by releasing all the revealing skins. If the game cant be played with one hand, they will fix that by making it easier. (They are good skins though I wont deny that). If youve played 1 mission in this game, youve played them all because anything varying from effortless running and shooting is reduced to the point it might as well not be in the game. I will say theyve changed it, you now get stuck on every little ridge and bump in the game regardless of who youre playing as.

The first descendant,Yoshihito,"While the core gameplay is fairly entertaining, I cannot in good conscience, recommend this game. Aside from server issues, which let's be honest, will always happen to any game at launch because it is unavoidable, Nexon has introduced an egregious and predatory monetization system. It's honestly no surprise. While you can play most of the game without opening your wallet, they make everything so grindy that it can take forever to get certain characters thanks to abysmally low drop rates.  The obvious comparison to this game is Warframe. They copy many of their systems but decided to implement them poorly with their monetization. The descendants are warframes, the ultimate versions are primes, they have the reactor system that doubles your mod capacity, and they have the forma system that changes the polarity of slots to halve the cost of mods fitted in that slot that are the same symbol. Warframe is a great game and my most played on Steam. While it is a monetized game, it's one of the best I've played. This game took the best parts of Warframe and made it even worse. People have done the math and at minimum, this game is 20x more expensive to do the same things you can do in Warframe.  The gameplay is fun, though the shooting can feel off at times, especially with server issues. The characters are fun, I enjoy playing as Bunny, running around, and shocking enemies to death. And the graphics are quite gorgeous. Some of the voice acting can leave much to be desired and they didn't even try to match the mouth animations to the words. I understand that this game is from Korea, so I can forgive them. You do get easy access to a couple of the descendants but after that, it becomes much more difficult to unlock them. Where Warframe gives players fairly easy farming methods to acquire base and prime variants, this game employs loot box style drops with abysmally poor rates.  While you might have fun with the game for a bit, there are just some turn offs that put a sour taste in your mouth. Honestly, if Nexon cared about their players they could have a fantastic game here. If they brought their pricing down in line with Warframe they could make money hand over fist with this game. There is a reason Warframe is one of the most successful and longest-running F2P games on the market.",Not Recommended,2024.07.06,31.8

The first descendant,Draylynn,"TL:DR - Many problems, predatory mall system and a seemingly copy-paste from other games uninspiring mess. Save yourself some time, don't. Honestly the games this tries to mimic are much better.  UI scaling is terrible, inventory UI and other interfaces just randomly cut off screen for no reason. Shaders are terrible and take excessive amounts of time to prepare, every time on my higher end rig, without a doubt one of the longest shader prep games I have 'ever' seen. Can't seem to remove the awful blur, animated objects at low FPS when they're <50m away... Your eyes are constantly bouncing from one detail to the other and failing to actually get any detail, it's giving me a literal migraine. Camera movement stutters, combat stutters... Player drifting when the connection to the server is interrupted for the entire party, or, just dodgy servers? Apparently the entire client needs to FPS freeze whilst it waits on a response from the server to load a mailbox or interact with an NPC etc (It's 2024...). Mobs and bosses able to shoot through solid objects... Combat is clunky (and presents nothing new to the genre).  Predatory payment system; Want to dye something? Remember that you don't use one dye per item, you use multiple dyes per item <- There is absolutely no need for this at all, none. Plus other red flags in the store, excessive pricing for one.  Get down to it, the first chunk of quests were kind of predictable and not very... Inspiring. Maybe they would have been more inspiring if the client let me configure the settings before entering the game so I actually go to see the intro movie and understand who I was, why I'm there etc, but alas, apparently pressing the options key fast-forwards you to ""No you can't do that, watch this first"", so a huge chunk of my introductory immersion went straight out the window because I couldn't watch it, good job.

Yes this is a free game but if you spend 10 years trying to unlock 1 thing you might as well spend that somewhere else. So many of my friends are dropping this game because of the drop rates, we spent 3 days trying to get 1 thing and it still did not drop. The company finally noticed things are not working as intended, we wait for more fixes i guess. Not everyone is seeing the poor drop rates so there are some people getting stuff they want easily. Its just there is more pain than joy because again... somethings require you step outside of your comfort zone just to get something, which makes a bad gaming experience for those who might be carrying you because you are having a tough time. Locking stuff behind the HARD content is not a fun gaming experience when you want to enjoy playing different characters and using their UNIQUE skill modules.  This is not your normal review post. This is a great game when the company responsible pull their finger out and actually do stuff.  This game needs some real work on the ""Join your friends"" aspect, as locking the zones to 4 people per instance is crazy. It is really simple to lock missions to 4 people by making those an instance that people join until it is capped at 4. Let us join friends already in an area instead of forcing them back to Albion just to make a group and then when you lose connection mid-mission you are able to re-join that mission for the next 5 minutes else give up the spot to someone else who pressed the ""Join"" marker. This still has not been improved, now Dec 2024.  Cons: - Expensive Prices set on the games currency - Characters are crazy expensive (you can get them for free though with hours of work in HARD content) - Outfits are extremely costly too and could easily take a reduction (more accessible = more purchases) - During the beta's paid currency was attainable for free by playing the game, this has since vanished upon release. Still no way to earn it for free. - Locking things behind content that is unplayable for players who have physical problems.

No care or effort was made to lipsync, and it is immersion shattering. Story is uninspired, lazy and cobbled together, while mission design is braindead, uninteresting and repetative.

Skills have a BIG impact on the game, some like it some would prefer weapons to be the main focus. My biggest point of critique is that you do the EXACT same thing for large parts of the story. Do most other similar games have mission structures that are similar to another? Yes but it has never felt as boring as in this entry as there basically exist 3 types of missions that are always carbon copies of another no variation at all. The VA and graphics however are lackluster in parts that I personally deem important. The hair of some of the stories main characters for example look like a 2015 skyrim mod while voices of NPCs in the main hub often sound like they were made by AI.

Look no further, please see items listed below for further explanation 1. They took Tracer, made a Temu version of her and then put it in as a playable character with just enough change to avoid a copy right infringement. 2. enemy boss gets balls, fight boss in 2d ball, player get no ball 3. Servers run as well as a dead hamster in a ball ( hamster might actually run smoother) 4. The Ads look like they got more work then this game so shout out to those guys 5. graphics look great(in 1 frame) but see ball related content on 3 6. took a bunch of ""inspiration""(Blantant copy paste literally worse than what chat gpt produced when it first came out) in mastery from warframe with combat similar to destiny 7. mixed a bunch of random stuff into a ball and shook it to somehow pick really good perks of Warframe and Destiny and then still fumble the bag 8. Throws so much loot at you that you kinda just feel like a mule 9. Hardest thing about this game is being able to play without crashing  In Summary, The First Descendant is like when you have really good looking art work but you can't see it because the art work constantly falls off the wall without you doing anything.

Unlike Warframe, whose monetization model has proven tried and true, you cannot even customize the base skin of ANY descendants, so any individuality goes out the window. If you did break down and buy a skin, colors are sold INDIVIDUALLY.  If they improved the MTX methods (it's Nexon, so they won't) this would be an easy recommend to friends.

Game play was smoother and abilities were less weak and leveling up was slow but more rewarding and felt like it actually did something. Graphics weren't as grainy and blurry and frames didn't have a stroke every time I used and ability. Stuff promised in the beta for closed testers that they said we could keep were taken away and left us and we were left with no compensation. They did it as an appreciation for us during it for spending our time playing and completing it too but I don't feel appreciated because well in the end we didn't get to keep anything. Now in order to have the items we (as in me and my partner who spent the entire closed and open beta playing and unlocked everything we could) used to have that we spent day's and nights on throughout the entire beta we now have to spend cash to but which would be 50 to 100 bucks for one skin. Also they really do prey on the weirdos in this game the reviews are right the skins really are like a censored porn game. Me and my boyfriend were MR 30 which was the beta cap.

You will easily be having to sort inventory every 10 mins at the default amount of invetory slots and the only way to expand is via cashshop. Honestly takes alot of the fun out of a looter shooter.

Its gameplay is good, the character designs are good, the unlock system for new characters and ultimate versions is overly convoluted but its a bonus that you can unlock ultimate versions like Prime versions from Warframe, but the biggest reason not to recommend it is the insanely predatory micro transaction practices. They put ultimate characters purchases in a different tab and put different packs that were almost double the price in the main storefront, They also did the typical practice of putting currency purchase amounts never being enough to you always have to overpay. They also dont have any way of earning premium currency for f2p players though I had heard that there used to be? Its really just not looking good for this rn. Why is this a problem? Well its a problem cause this no longer a game but a store with a game on the side, people will say just don't pay but if people don't pay this game will get shut down, its just a terrible situation with this and its so disheartening to see what could be a solid game that will die as soon as items in the store stop selling.  Also some other points. The battlepass doesnt give you enough to get the next one? Thats pretty gross, at least even in CoD and Fortnite completing the battlepass gives you enough to purchase the next.  You cant paint default skins so if you get paints you have to buy a skin? So everyone will just be default coloured characters unless they pay. Sounds pretty tiny as a problem but both Destiny and Warframe do not paywall visual customisation this much. The paints also being one time use is crazy, so you only get some and can only use them once.  Daily Limits on RNG drops for unlocking things? Im sorry what? I get trying to get people to play over extended periods but not everyone has time to play every single day, heck some days Id play games for 8 hours and others not at all, and so this just makes things annoying that I cant just grind out something in one go.

The first descendant,EL MUGNETO,"The gear and progression is pretty interesting, however, the missions manage to be more shallow and repetitive than even launch Destiny, with every area having you do around 8 missions which boil down to running to an arena and fighting mobs while doing some extremely basic task until a yellow health bar enemy shows up. These missions are meant to be farmable, there is no spectacle or unique gameplay tied to these missions.  The most compelling part of the game for me was the customization options and the boss fights, you are able to fight a new boss every few levels and soloing them was a fun challenge. And you have mods which you can upgrade to get very significant stat boosts. Unfortunately there is clearly much, much grinding to get to the endgame to be able to fully enjoy build crafting.  I got tired of the storytelling pretty quickly and started skipping all dialogue, perhaps there is something good there, but I can't say I find that a likely possibility.

The first descendant,Rolaf,"I have played this game since the first closed testing started and here are my thoughts. I didn't play much after release cuz the important and game breaking stuff didn't change.  This game blatantly copied systems from Destiny 2 and Warframe... But I'm ok with it. Blizzard does it all the time with their games. But here is the kicker Warframe has a fair monetization while this game on the other hand doesn't. You can get everything in Warframe fairly easily. With player driven economy you can play what you want sell the loot you got for plat and buy what you want. Sometimes the game forces you to play some aspects of it but I call it a fair monetization because you never feel like you need to buy something. This game on the other hand... well forces your hand with 1 percent drop rates and endless boring grind.  I can't compare this to Warframe or Destiny2 at all. The only thing going for this game is character design, graphics and thats it. I really hate the way grappling hook works and looks. Also there is no slide nor vaulting animations.  Boss encounters are good but they become stale after a while. Since you are looking for 4 items with 3 percent chance if you wanna craft new Descendants.  All of the upgrades and mods are for stats and build crafting is not really there I mean you can still do somethings but its not like Warframe they might improve on this since the characters have potential.

The first descendant,RustyDev,"Let me start by saying that this game isn't awful. However, I do want to make it clear that this game has a long way away from being something good.  There are multiple problems from every avenue of design. The narrative was bland and difficult for me to follow anyways, and the dialogue felt really flat as well.  Level design in this game felt more like filling out empty space rather than making interesting composed shots with good encounters, a lot of the beautiful work that was done by the environment artists was hidden by this. Additionally, the concepts for the settings themselves either felt pretty boring for a sci fi game, or felt ripped from Destiny 2.  The UI was alright, but had a few pitfalls as well, having the player need to look places they wouldn't think of in order to get certain info they needed.  I'll give credit to the characters and the abilities, those were pretty interesting to play around with, but unfortunately the combat didn't feel too interesting either. Often enemies felt really easy to kill with minimal effort on my side to equip the best guns, and every enemy that was more difficult was really more of a sponge than an actually interesting enemy.  Overall, a disappointing game that makes me wish I was playing Destiny instead, wouldn't recommend unless Destiny REALLY isn't giving you enough to do.  At least for now.

The first descendant,KnickKnacks,"Predatory and egregious use of microtransactions from a company that has already been caught and fined by the FTC earlier this year for deceptive business practices in their games. I understand cosmetic items and battle pass being charged with a premium, but that doesn't justify pricing bundles beyond the worth of a full-fledged AAA game and then proceeding to charge more mtx upon mtx in the forms of paint options, resources, and crafting. It doesn't help that the premium currency options are also improperly priced where you will either buy too much or too little of it if you do decide to pay. All of this is barely tolerable as it is ingame only for the fact you technically don't need to pay to progress through the entire game, though knowing the company, this may be subject to change in the future. Of course, YMMV and how much of these MTX you can put up with all depends on your level of self-control and patience with this game.  It really is a shame because the gameplay is actually amazing for a ""F2P"" title. As a looter shooter, this game is fun and engaging and is definitely worth checking out if you like Warframe, Destiny, or The Division. Gunfights are very engaging, characters are very unique, and there is plenty of build variety and options to tackle missions however you like it. That being said, I would not recommend financially investing in this game until prices get adjusted. And if you get to the point where you feel the need to pay the game to continue progressing, drop the game altogether.

Here I will list out why this is a thumbs down >Solo invasion in a 'co-op' game. Who thought this was a good idea?

This means you use more forma, for a build which will be useless in team play, because again this is a co-op game.

(This was now fixed, but why leave it broken for a whole week? Guess to pressure sell the bp head?)  This game taught me why some of warframe's early decisions were good. All of season 1 content is ""locked"" behind hard mode, and the story mission is fairly difficult. This means if you start out new, it will take you quite a while to get to this part. Warframe was never like this. If you had certain star char progression, you could participate in events, and they weren't this hard either.

The gameplay and gunplay are so boring. The most uninspired copy of already well established games.  A new game should give you that novelty feel that makes you want to keep playing it, to sit through the story and dialogues, to explore the game systems , but this game absolutely fails at it all.

The first descendant,Friction,"The First Descendant, a looter shooter promising a fresh take on the genre, ultimately delivers a mixed bag. While its initial appeal lies in its vibrant world and solid gunplay, the game's repetitive gameplay loop and lackluster narrative quickly wear thin.  The core gameplay loop, while initially engaging, soon becomes predictable. Missions often devolve into monotonous waves of enemy encounters, lacking the variety and strategic depth that would keep players invested. The loot system, though satisfying at first, fails to deliver the truly exceptional and game-changing items that define the genre. Character customization options are limited, and the progression system feels grindy and unrewarding.  The game's narrative is a particular disappointment. It's a generic tale of a chosen one fighting against an overwhelming evil, lacking the depth and complexity that would elevate the experience. The world, while visually appealing, feels lifeless and devoid of interesting characters or meaningful interactions.  Performance issues also mar the experience. Frequent frame rate drops and stuttering can be distracting and frustrating, particularly in intense combat situations.  While The First Descendant shows promise, its flaws ultimately outweigh its strengths. With a more focused approach to gameplay, a stronger narrative, and improved performance, it could have been a truly exceptional looter shooter. As it stands, however, it's a missed opportunity.",Not Recommended,2024.10.17,404.8

And it's a ""maybe"". Visually it's stunning, gameplay-wise it's serviceable and terms of story, it's lacking. Grind is the name of the game, though it's relatively reasonable allowing you to get all Descendants you wish for free, while skins are locked behind purchases with their proprietary coins, as expected. And you will need plenty of coins for just about any bit of customization.  It's not a bad game and the developers are listening to feedback. Changes come regularly and there is a rudimentary roadmap of what's coming, but there comes a point when playing that you ask yourself ""why am I really playing this?"". The longer you do, the harder it becomes to justify choosing The First Descendant over a more mature and feature-rich game like the oft compared to Warframe. Unfortunately, if you are playing for the Descendants or a self-righteous attempt at revenge against the awful, scary woke crowd, there's just not much for you to really do. And the community is split too, between those wanting more fanservice and those wanting improvements to core elements of the game.

The first descendant,ANYER,"Product received for free  I started to play this with my husband, it was a new MMO that was being released in Beta and I wanted something that would be a new breath of games that I can play with him. In my honest opinion, as you can see, the game is a no-go for me.  First of all, this is obviously a game in which they want you to spend money for it's very selective and yes, SEDUCTIVE women. The male character models vs the female ones are so stark - barely can compare the two since they detail the females models to the tiniest pixel and just leave the male model skins so lackluster, with no exciting or nice-looking skins. So, if thats for you, that's cool.  But if you're genuinely looking for a MMO-RPG that won't be so click baity in the sense that they won't over sexualize the female models and make the male models look medicore in comparison, this might not be the game for you.  Secondly, the game is okay in it's missions. They are very straight forward with great indicators telling you where to go, but if you're playing on steam deck - be prepared that you might experience huge lag when entering mission ""dungeons"" as you progress through the story line. Aiming is pretty crucial, and something that my husband mentioned - it's very comparable to Destiny 2.  Lastly, the story line is comparable to Warframe, where some kind of person who knows more about what you're looking for than what you do in a crucial moment, with missions centered in resolving the gap in knowledge while obtaining items to unlock free playable characters as you progress. There is no race system or class system per se, the character selection is comparable to Genshin Impact. The korean voice acting is amazingly casted, with voices that really fit the look. The English is a hit or miss in it's voice casting to be honest, some characters sound like they fit - other's don't.  To summarize, if scored from a 1-10 scale rating - it's a 4.5.

They have this feature called Vaults, random map chests that can be opened with keys you collect from elite enemies. EVERYHING of progression value is going to need their contents and the keys are incredibly rare, are not interchangeable (there's 8 different types of keys and vaults mostly random) and you can fail at opening them instantly expending that hard earned key.

Cant win the boss fight = no progression for you. F.u.  after 262hours (wasted?).  End game is so boring, repetitive and punishing.

It's so unoriginal you can't even argue they just blatantly stole a bunch of mechanics (and some assets even) from existing games and mashed them together.  The ""narrative"" (if it can even be called that) is a generic cliché of ""humanity has fallen and suddenly we got cool powers and this very evil guy wants them"", throwing at you lore and terms as if you were supposed to know them all. Speaking of, this game suffers heavily of throwing everything at you syndrome, barely introducing you to how the game actually works just to show you how cool their hub is and how many people are there in the game.  As for the enemy design it's also very unoriginal and repetitive, there's really nothing special about them and the first ""boss"" you fight after the intro on a dungeon is actually so boring I legitimately fell asleep midway.  In regards to the store, I can't say much as the game was so unappealing for me I didn't even bother checking it, so maybe read other reviews for that.

First off I'm not one to normally write a review like this, but this game issues are on a whole new level. I normally like to buy something small in game to give a little kick back to the devs, If I play the game for a bit. I decided to do so for this game. BIG MISTAKE!  After I bought some Calibers (in game premium currency). After the transaction went though I noticed I didnt get the calibers in game. when Looking at the transaction history, it said that I used them 2 hours prior to when I bought them (Huh?).  Steam redirected me to Nexons support to try to get the Calibers. I started to write the ticket, but thought maybe I needed to link the account with Nexon to get it. After I Linked the account, I could no longer write to ticket to nexon as it would error out when trying to sign in.  After that, I just wanted a refund for the transaction, but steam refuses to do so as apparently i used them already (2 hours prior to buying them....) I ended up un-linking my account to Nexon's. When doing so, I lost everything in game, and had to start all over. I'm still in help desk ticket hell trying to get a refund or something.  Game seems like it would be fun in the short term but this experience left a really bad taste in my mouth.  TLDR: -You may not get Calibers and cant get refund if you buy through Steam. -Do not link your account with Nexon.

Even the repeatable missions have a very similar feel to the ones in Warframe. Again, without any new spin or re-imagination, just a blatant copy.  The core gameplay mechanics and overall visual presentation are serviceable - a notable exception would be the lackluster voice ""acting"". Overall it feels void of interesting activities and even barebones in some parts aswell - Large areas where absolutely nothing happens. The instanced boss-battles are pretty fun though and in my opinion the only small highlight in the game.

The game looks visually pleasing to the eyes. The gameplay feels solid. The character design is great as well. However, when you look beyond the initial experience, you will realize just how bad of a game this is. The balance between the characters is non-existent. The game becomes a breeze with certain descendants and very difficult with others. The loot system is bland, uninspired, and feels like it is designed to force you to pull out your wallet. The drop rate for stuff you need to upgrade your descendants and weapons is very low. As such you can either repeat the same activities for hours or just pull out your wallet to get what you want.

Mostly due to the Devs not respecting that people have to spend real time using their their awful systems - None of the issues many people had with these time wasting systems with the Beta have been addressed.  It is not quick to do anything, everything has a dumb cut scene or animation or extra screen - EVERYTHING. When you take something out of research or you make something or you level up or whatever - it's a painful system that wastes hours I could be spending actually playing the game and enjoying it - I would be happy to spend a few quid on something if they just fixed that.  No fast travel menu. Within ""town"" you have to walk everywhere through it's ridiculous layout without a straight path anywhere - often back and forth multiple times through something that makes no sense for humans at all. There are TWO fast travel points in the town and they are both equally far away from everything.  The constant running back and forth to NPCs is terrible. Run to this pink marker, Press E, Press a button with the mouse, wait 2 secs, Hold Esc. Repeat. The story is AWFUL and the voice acting patronising and trite LET US SKIP THIS TRASH.  Movement system and collision is awful, get stuck on enemies, get stuck on the floor, get stuck in walls, GET STUCK ON YOUR TEAM - yeah give us a movement based character that requires the being able to move to do damage and then make it get stuck on EVERYTHING - can't even run up a slight slope without dead stopping.  Gunplay is terrible. You can't use cover as standing within 6ft of a anything solid means you are shooting the solid object and not the enemy you have a clear unobstructed aim of - most notably in the boring ass boss arena where you can't take cover but the boss can!  Mission clarity is terrible. Newer players have no idea what is going on when walking into some missions and there is no way to communicate what is going on to them, it can take multiple failures before they either leave or get the hint and start following the lead of someone who knows what they are doing.  The UI - Simple things like being able to go back in menus without having to leave the interface and start over are missing, Its an absolute hot mess of disjointed systems mashed together.  The HUD - LET ME REMOVE THE HEALTH AND AMMO FROM FLOATING IN THE MIDDLE OF MY DAMN SCREEN!!! PUT IT IN THE CORNER LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME FFS. Why do we have those icons in the right? PUT MY DAMN AMMO COUNT THERE! PUT MY HEALTH AND SHIELD AT THE BOTTOM!! make the other blue bars TINY and put them under the health and shield - they literally don't matter.

The recently released Season 1 seems to not be really aimed at everyone... the invasions are only solo dungeon's at this point, they include puzzles and a pretty difficult boss at the end of the dungeon. All of the bosses have some level of immunity phase, and regenerating shield and health - this proves to be challenging DPS check for a fairly large portion of the player base and it's created a fairly toxic environment in forums. Seasonal content shouldn't just cater to the upper echelon of the player base, yet it seems to be aimed at a small percentage of players, and I would argue that since most dungeon's can be played solo or as a group, they need to do the same for the invasion dungeons...

Pro: Candy eye everywhere. Weapon performance its really good. Game stability. Interesting bossing mechanics. Bunny only speaks on the first map.   Cons: Missions are repetitive and boring, bosses ""ball"" mechanic its annoying and super cheap implemented. Missions feel unrewarding for the time spend, (unless you just play bunny) Meta game: speed and over grind the same mission definitely. No pity system. The amazing world created and the little charisma you can get for the descendants doesnt build up to a point where you can get attached to them, story its.... just there...  Game doesn't have a soul (yet), im pretty sure the game will get a soul one day and that maybe the developers will care more for creating a deeper story for every descendant, but for now they are just tools.  Bunny, a mayor flaw on design, other characters just don't feel useful at the moment, why bother to play anything else, if you can destroy everything with a nicely build bunny, this can be easily address by making the game feel more rewarding, but repetition its the key to success here, so why bother.  Monetization: It is true, you can get all the descendants for free, also its true you can get the activators an catalyst for free, however, as been a direct copy from warframe, it differs a lot on the monetization aspect, if you compare it directly to warframe you require 3 to 4 forma (catalyst) to place all the mods you will like, in this game, you will need a catalyst for every single mod you will want to have for your build, and by itself it doesnt sound bad, but the simple way to farm 1 catalyst its boring, tedious and no rewarding, now imagine doing it everytime for every descendant or weapon you will want to build up, its simply too much waste of time to do it., building, switching between descendants and adapting its the intended gameplay however I cant invest the time necessary to get my descendants to a relevant point, with the fear of game being behind a company like Nexon. Adding to the point if the game will progress on the ""raid"" route, having more than one build and adapting will be extremely necessary.

The UX is baffling, the UI is indecipherable, and the amount of information is so weak it might as well not be there at all. And forget about understanding the story. They may as well drop you into book 3 of a 10 book series with no preamble.  You just go to a place that has a flag that looks similar to one you have on your quest list, press the button to start the mission and hope it's the right one. This means you often end up playing the same mission multiple times since the quest don't update and the rewards are... subpar to say the least.  The gun play is fun, but the upgrading system leaves a lot to be desired (exasperated by the poor UI and UX). They have a use recommended option but I sort of like to understand what and why.

This game is 300 - 900 a character with NO slot and NO capacity booster.  - Warframe charges 20 premium currency for Mod increasing items and can by a pack of 3 for 35.

I am not convinced about it, and yet there is something I cant put my finger on to like here- so I will give it a bit more time and see where this leads. I do find a lot more negatives for superficial reasons than there are positives. Pros: -The visuals and cinematic are solid, and it looks pretty. -The combat feels good, though the grappling hook on bosses doesnt really seem very effective or good so far... very janky.  Cons: - In the trailer you see so much action. Jumping, flipping, diving through windows, taking cover... YOU CANNOT DO ANY OF THIS. Your character just runs, jumps barely, sprints everywhere with no stamina management, and does not have the ability to take cover, nor cross thresholds like windows. - Unfortunately, the voice acting is some of the worst I have ever seen in a video game from Asia. It literally is without ANY emotion, no inflection.Its really bad and ruins the cut scenes and story because you cant barely stick through it. Imagine trying to have a conversation about serious situations with someone who has either NO personality, or a girl who squeaks in a high pitched words and positivity. Then multiply that times 10. And you'll maybe get close to how annoying the dialogue is. - The story is extremely predicable so far. I mean VERY VERY VERY predictable. You wont see anything here you havent seen in every Korean or Japanese or Chinese future game and anime. When a cut scene plays, you might as well get a cup of coffee. - NPC personalities are literally bland and tropes. No effort was put into the character arc in any real way. They definitely needed to hire someone from my writing team in Hollywood to just do a BASIC character arc development sit-down. - Thus far, the game seems overly complicated to upgrade gear. I mean like just a lot of trash to pick up, a lot of things needed to upgrade what should be a SIMPLE upgrade task. Its going to be too much in late game, I GUARANTEE IT, and people with jobs and other games to play are going to get very frustrated by how complicated this is. Its literally like building a long term puzzle to upgrade gear. - as far as I can tell, you dont get descendants to play beyond the first 3 without getting genetic code or something... which is disappointing. It means that most of the game you are going to spend running around with everyone being the same and looking the same. And that sucks. They could have given us a few more. I dont like any of the three picks you start with so far. They are all bland and boring and lack real personality.  So, thus far.... meh. We will see I guess. I want it to succeed, but I think that the lack of interesting characters and complete lack of character arc or romantic options is going to create a situation where players just feel like this is something that will burn out quickly and there is no reason to invest hundreds of hours into a world and staff of characters that are without any real connection to the player. I mean, the truth is, you either need GREAT voice acting and the ability to create an emotional response that way, or romantic options with characters to create a feeling of connection in the arc... NONE OF THIS EXISTS in its current state. Its just combat and gear, and we all have D4 and Destiny, and Division for such things. Plus, 19 heroes, and you stuck me with the most bland 3 to start and play with.... not really a good selling point. I will keep playing to see where it leads, to see if it gets better.

I have never had such an experience in either Destiny or Warframe....and for those who know....you know how bad warframe can get with those flashy frame ability combos xD And upon further inspection, its overworking my CPU and nothing else. I suffer endless loading, which shouldn't be happening as its being run through a NVME ssd, and with 32GB RAM (4x8GB), the game shouldn't be as bad as it is, overloading my CPU with all it's freezes and crashes.

The first descendant,Freebite,"All the comparisons between Warframe and Destiny are all correct. It really is as if those two had a child. Sounds kind of awesome right? Well, unfortunately, this child was raised by predatory mobile game developers who were trying to remake anthem. This game also has an issue where, every single thing it seems to do right, it does at least one thing badly.  For example, it has a grappling hook, it's kinda fun to swing yourself around, a good thing. but then directly related to the grappling hook, the enemies do not know how to react to you swinging around and just stand there confused, that's one of the bad things.  The graphics are pretty good, but then it doesn't run smoothly at all on an Nvidia 3070 using the recommended (high) settings, bad.  The movement when you are just fighting and running around, albeit a bit floaty, has a decent flow to it. Then there are missions that make you have to stop, hold E to pick something up, then run to a drop off point, while you are holding that item you can do NOTHING but run and grapple. Cast an ability (even non-offensive ones), you drop it, try to reload or shoot, you drop it and have to hold E to pick it back up ruining the flow.  The bosses are big, kinda fun, have weak points that you can knock off, you can grapple on to them to do damage as well, nicely telegraphed attacks making them easy enough to dodge but you have to pay attention, they have enraged states, all good stuff. The arenas, while kind of generic looking, are also somewhat destructible by the boss, so if the boss is shooting missiles at you you can hide behind cover but that cover will break making the arenas feel somewhat dynamic. However the bosses don't change or really react to you knocking pieces off though, making it just a system for dealing damage, you can't damage it's weapon to make it unable to shoot or anything interesting, they also have fairly basic patterns and don't mix anything up through the whole fight. The bosses are still a highlight of the game.  The world feels mostly cohesive with nice fantasy mixed with sci-fi aesthetic. But then it has sexy french maid costumes and dino pajamas for cosmetics. I'm not against sexy costumes, the skin tight bodysuits and leotards don't bother me a bit and pretty much fit the aesthetic of the game, but seeing a character dressed as a maid jumping onto a boss to punch it's shoulder armor takes me out of the experience a bit when it's the only thing really out of place.  One final example for this review I noticed as a good thing followed by a bad thing, the skin ""Bunny's Speedy Awakened One"" it is an evolving skin meaning it has 3 versions that unlock as you use it, the final version looks absolutely awesome. It has see through parts that let you see an electrified cybernetic skeleton, it genuinely looks cool. However that skin has an issue, the parts that aren't see through on the outside, ARE see through on the inside. They forgot to texture the inside surface of the skin. Sure that sounds kind of nitpicky, but if I'm expected to spend 1900 caliber, 40 USD worth of premium currency (no joke), that skin better be perfect and be actually worth the cost of an entire other game, such as Helldivers 2.  That lack of attention to detail is also throughout the entire game, typos in subtitles, bugs, the tacked on feel of some of the systems. The only thing that doesn't suffer from this is the monetization system. From manipulative premium currency amounts, making it impossible to buy just the right amount always being a bit over or under, to extremely expensive skins, characters, boosts, ""limited time"" section for fomo, inventory slots, a battle pass that you can skip levels on, so far the only thing I don't see for sale are the weapons themselves.  It's so close to being good, it has a good platform to become something great, but all the systems around it need to be reworked and made to really fit together, everything feels a bit disjointed, janky, and buggy.  Maybe in a few years it could become something worth while, but as it is now I do NOT recommend.",Not Recommended,2024.07.10,24.1

Its in its early stages so it only has so much content and I really am hoping for the next few big updates to bring out some new content to interact with that makes it much more fun to play and engaging. This game I think has a promising future as long as their monetization structure stops being so stupid.  Remember though, don't give the game a bad review if it isn't for you.

There isn't much world-building and the story mainly focuses on killing a villain.  Warframe has a more complex story line that I feel works a lot better.  If they fix the story for this game, add a lot more features than repetitive missions and worked on world-building, I think it'd be an awesome title.

The first descendant,Aedanis,"It would seem that whatever patch they did a few days ago prevents new players from being able to play the game. I have a GeForce RTX 4060, an intel i9 14900kf processor, and 32gb of ram, and I can barely get it to launch to the main menu (Which is one weird main menu... access to options, and access to enter the game. Nothing else.) without it crashing on me. Even when I do, I get locked up at shader processing. A little digging and I found that I'm not the only one - its not only a common issue all around, it's a major issue with Intel in the first place. No fix i could find online corrected this.  Please, for the sake of your computer and sanity, don't try to play this right now. It's so poorly optimized that it feels like NEXON broke their game on purpose.  EDIT: So, a few clarifications to this. The issue stems from newer generation Intel processors, and a slight issue in how the manufacturers set default power settings. The key here is that they are different from Intel default settings in most motherboard manufacturers' BIOS, which means if you have constant crashes, or drop frames, or can't even load the game, you have to update BIOS just to play this game. And if you bought your PC third-party, you have to go through THE THIRD PARTY VENDOR to get the right version to flash your board with. A lot of work for one game. But it doesn't end there.  The game itself, now that I've had a chance to play it, feels okay as a lazy shooter game. The controls and weapon swapping feel nice, though I could do without the slight delay between hitting an enemy and their health dropping. The issue I now have is how empty the world itself feels when you aren't doing a mission. Very few patrol enemies actually spawn for me to shoot at, and it feels more like I'm roaming from mission to mission just to do stuff, railroading one into having to select an objective to do content. It feels like a false open world, if that makes sense.  My other gripe is the story itself, and the voice acting. A good portion of the voice acting so far feels very forced, or perhaps even AI generated. Some of it is good, but even when the voice acting is good, the story falls a bit short. I can't entirely explain how - perhaps its just a more critical viewpoint - but the story itself doesn't hit like a narrative focus should. I don't feel any pull to pursue the story, and I've played games like Destiny 2 which have a similar story style.  TL:DR, you have to q-flash BIOS to even play the game, which is poorly optimized, has less-than-stellar voice acting, and a non-compelling story with bland characters.

People will match with you to fight said boss and because each character requires so much time commitment to level they will being playing an electric character against a boss that is very strong against such meaning they are there for a carry essentially.

This is not warframe; warframe has matchmaking. This isn't pay to win, it's pay to progress which means you'll be forced at some point to spend money or run 12 hours for one mod.  It took me 12 hours to get one mod that was then outclassed by other mods.

Boring and completely replaceable missions follow one after the other, where you fight the same handful of a few visually completely incohesive enemy types, with no end in sight.  Meanwhile the game metaphorically buries you in loot, where within minutes you're likely going to acquire the same weapon with different stats, making inventory management, or rather cleanup, mandatory. Not only does this worsen the value of getting new weapons, it also really doesn't help that most weapons are almost identical to others of the same class. And with the ammo system the game employs, those actually fun and interesting weapons you get every now and then, will run out of ammo constantly.

The first descendant,a1mzu,"The First Descendant"" enters the gaming arena with lofty ambitions but ultimately succumbs to egregious monetization tactics and unethical data practices, severely detracting from its gameplay appeal. What could have been an immersive experience is marred by the game's relentless pursuit of profit at the expense of player enjoyment and privacy.  From the outset, players are bombarded with advertisements ( like skins ) and coercive prompts to make in-game purchases. These interruptions disrupt the flow of gameplay, transforming what should be an engaging adventure into a tiresome exercise in dodging microtransactions. Progression through the game is hindered by paywalls, creating an uneven playing field that favors those willing to spend exorbitant amounts on virtual items.  Beyond its predatory monetization, ""The First Descendant"" has been embroiled in controversy regarding its data practices. Reports have surfaced alleging that the game collects and sells player data without consent, compromising user privacy and trust. Such actions not only violate ethical standards but also betray the fundamental trust that players place in developers to safeguard their personal information.  While the game may boast visually appealing graphics and an intriguing storyline, these positives are overshadowed by its exploitative business model and disregard for player privacy. The relentless pursuit of profit through aggressive monetization tactics and unethical data practices undermines any enjoyment that ""The First Descendant"" might otherwise offer.  In conclusion, players looking for a fair and enjoyable gaming experience should approach ""The First Descendant"" with caution.

The first descendant,Siecefire,"Well, after an extensive amount of playtime, giving the game another fair chance, I can confidently say that Nexon is still Nexon. Meaning greedy as all hell. The game was enjoyable until season 1 came out and my friends and I quickly realized the greedy plan. You can only do the seasonal content on Hard Mode in the game, which means that unless you have energy activators and plenty of catalysts, you are NOT going to successfully complete the season 1 story. As a matter of fact, you won't come close. It is obvious that the intention of pre-season play was to create a sense of investment in players to the point where they would be more psychologically willing to spend money on energy activators and catalysts to boost the characters and play the season on hard mode, since normal is not available. These items are difficult to grind for and very time consuming of course. So the scam is to get you to buy them. Here's the kicker, you still won't be strong enough even with them. Invasion bosses still one-shot you, the puzzles are frustrating and unnecessary. There is also no TEAM play in invasion missions, which of course is another ""give us money"" tactic.  I admittedly spent a decent amount of money as I was enjoying pre-season, but please I am telling you do NOT spend money on this game. This game is akin to digital prostitution.

There's next to no variety in that regard. - Enemy spawn rates are painfully slow in many areas. I found that most of my time in early missions was spent waiting for the next 4 or 5 enemies to spawn. - Difficulty curve is basically nonexistent, until you get to Echo Swamp where suddenly the enemies actually start to hurt.

The first descendant,Raison,"The First Descendant Review  Introduction: ""The First Descendant"" is a free-to-play third-person looter shooter that promises a captivating experience with its high-quality graphics and engaging gameplay. However, after spending some time with the game, it quickly becomes apparent that it struggles to live up to these promises.   The storyline of ""The First Descendant"" is unfortunately lackluster and fails to draw players in. The narrative feels generic, offering nothing new or compelling to keep players invested. The gameplay, while initially exciting, soon becomes repetitive. Missions often follow a similar pattern, leading to a monotonous experience that fails to keep the player's interest for long.   One of the game's few highlights is its impressive graphics. The visuals are stunning, and the attention to detail is commendable. However, this comes at a cost. The time required to compile shaders before you can start playing is excessively long, which can be frustrating for players eager to jump into the action.   As with many free-to-play games, ""The First Descendant"" heavily relies on microtransactions. The in-game purchases are intrusive and can significantly impact the overall enjoyment of the game. Many other reviews echo this sentiment, noting how the aggressive monetization detracts from the overall experience.   Overall, ""The First Descendant"" feels like a missed opportunity. While it may attract players with its free-to-play model and impressive graphics, it fails to offer a compelling narrative or engaging gameplay. The repetitive nature of the missions and the overwhelming presence of microtransactions further diminish its appeal. It seems unlikely that this game will maintain a lasting player base, and it may struggle to stay relevant beyond its initial release period. In summary, it's a no from me.",Not Recommended,2024.07.04,0.8

The first descendant,folko1,"It's not bad, but it just feels lacking. It's just a more boring Destiny mashed with Warframe. It plays okay, tho animations feel like they could use a bit of a touch up. The story isn't all that captivating.. I can tell TFD is trying to take a page outta Destiny 2 with the different ammo type weapons like physical, energy and power weapons, but it just doesn't really work as much, since D2's purpose of different gun types was: physical was your main damage dealer, energy dealt with enemy shields which would block out damage from your physical weapon, and power was your heavy hitter you'd save for tough enemies. TFD is just damage but plenty, damage but scarce, damage but scarce-er. And it also kinda feels like some weapons appear better than others in the same category. Like handcannon and scout rifle for example, which in a preview, looks like scout rifle would just be the better choice flat out cuz of more dps, mag capacity and fire-rate, but maybe I'm overlooking something.  All in all, it's a nice game, not bad, not good tho. It's okay.  I can't recommend, because it kind of reminded me too much of destiny that I just started thinking ""maybe I should just go play destiny"" soooo... Yeah. A game shouldn't really make you feel like wanting to play a different game, and in this instance, the game that this one is sort of based on.  Definitely try it out tho, and see if it is for you.

The first descendant,chuangtzu[ita],"It's a pity having to review negatively this game, because a lot about it is really good. The gameplay, the graphics and performances, are great. The music and sound effects and the story are also decent although not stellar. Although with microtransactions, the game seemed easy for me actually so I just kept playing but I was in for a not too unexpected surprise - more on that later.  The game is let down by some odd design choices - perhaps influenced by the microtransaction model (many also claim it harvests an hell of a lot of your personal data).  For over 20 hours of play, I did not find the game difficult at all except the bosses of the final missions in each area. I thought that's fine, I will join a public lobby just for this, although it made it much less fun since it became ridicolously easy. It just doesn't seem right that you have two option, private and public, and they differ in difficulty that much, but anyhow I kept going.  I have then hit a hurdle at a colossus-boss called ""the devourer"", which is almost impossible to beat unless you farm for days (or buy the goodies to save time - see what they did?) to get the right gear. The game was already getting pretty repetitive to me by that point, so I only tried to farm a little bit and then went to read online only to find that many others are complaining about the same issue. I could have perhaps wasted some time had I found out that the rest of the game would have gone smoother, but a common answer was ""if you don't like this you'll see later - especially pyro"" so I gave up on the game.  In short, this publisher managed to disguise a Pay-to-win game in a really clever way, and since I don't want to waste my life farming for digital items nor I want to pay to improve the characters (they also say it's very expensive) it's a no-go and even if I had a really good time especially the first 5-10 hours, overall it's a net negative.",Not Recommended,2024.07.19,23.7

The first descendant,Simon Dufour,"Product received for free  ""The First Descendant"" - A Promising Start, Hampered by Technical Issues  My initial experience with ""The First Descendant"" was a mix of excitement and frustration. Even on Low settings, my laptop struggled to maintain a stable 30fps, turning into a veritable furnace in the process.  Thankfully, a GPU driver update significantly improved performance, allowing me to finally appreciate the game's potential. The engaging prologue drew me in, leaving me eager to explore further.  For a solid 10 minutes, I was thoroughly enjoying the combat, building up anticipation for the upcoming boss encounter. The pre-battle cutscene was truly impressive, but then... bam, the game crashed to desktop. No warning, no error message, just a sudden end to my adventure.  While I understand that technical issues can happen, especially with new releases, it's disheartening to encounter them so early on.

The first descendant,TremsWorld,"Review as of ~70 hours: Haven't finished the main story, It keeps getting significantly harder to the point where I have to endless grind for some meager upgrades. Its not a game for casual FPS players. The game by design pushes you towards looking at the cash shop from several different angles. Grinding the characters takes a long time and you only get two to start, which wouldn't be a problem except some of the grind is locked out by requiring certain characters (attributes for void shards). It was fun for the first few hours but still felt very shallow, story writing is meh and can be ignored, voice acting is worse (its probably AI). Its not bad for a F2P game, but its not good either. Expect this game to die very quickly when the next big thing releases, though the developers will support it as long as the MTX cash cow is flowing. If I could change one thing about the game it would have been giving us access to more characters at the beginning so we can try different play styles rather than be forced to grind a different character if we didn't like our first choice, or maybe making the story bosses a bit easier.",Not Recommended,2024.07.17,68.8

It's clear that at no point was 'fun' ever considered as a priority, because the game simply loops the exact same content over when you progress to the next area.  The story in this game is a non-starter. I think it might have been written by an executive's pre-schooler. To say it was written by Chat GPT would be a lie, GPT could do a much better job.

The drop rates for materials needed for the better characters is the most ridiculous nonsense I have seen in gaming. I don't mind games based on RNG, however 1) you not only need to be successful with RNG from a mission reward to get the amorphus material (lootbox) you then need to do another mission to open said lootbox and be successful again to get the item you were after in the first place. 2) I do not believe Nexon when they say the drop rates are accurate. The occasional string of bad luck is one thing. but it is quite another when every single material towards items that can be paid for (such as characters) just so happens to come with suspiciously poor luck I begin to smell foul play. Additionally the missions you need to complete over and over again to get these materials get old astonishingly quickly.

It doesn't stop there either, you can only craft 5 items at once. This is fine as long as you're swiping the timers away, though! If you care about character customization be prepared to swipe. If you wanna keep more than 10 characters on your roster be prepared to swipe. I enjoy playing this game. Dare I say, I even like it.

Random thoughts on the game: The game has mixed english voice acting with some being alright and others sounding laughably bad. Character and cosmetic designs are sexist and horny. If you want to put the women in skimpy clothes then at least add the option to male characters too, cowards! Other than that it is really similar to Warframe in that every new thing I saw in the game made me think, ""Hey, this is in Warframe"" or ""Wow, Warframe's system is the exact same"". Some things are different though and I do like some of the changes. Not having to return to a hub area after every single mission and being able to run mission after mission in the same area was legitimately an improvement over Warframe.

The first descendant,MuffCannon,"Slutty Destiny with bad writing, bad voice acting, and soulless weapon design.  This is a free game that's meant to make money. It's not meant to actually be enjoyable. It's meant to hook players with decent (although incoherent) visuals, and manipulate the player into buying a ridiculous amounts of in game currency for cosmetics.  Visually appealing world design and decent side missions will make the gameplay semi fun. For a free game it's good. For the paid sections of the game, it's ridiculously bad. The story and dialogue are bad though, like really bad. Missions seem disconnected due to poor exposition by the writing and dialogue. The main story is very poorly explained or depicted. Usually with narrative writing for visual media, you have two options with setting the basis of the story; show me or tell me. This accomplishes neither of those. The characters are also not flushed out story wise, there's just nothing about them that makes you particularly care about them or their goals.  The gun-play is also very lackluster. Similar to Destiny, many guns don't feel or sound powerful, they sound and look like toys. The balancing is decent, but the combat is kind of boring. Enemies either charge directly at you or shoot from a small distance away and with little coordination. The enemies feel hollow and look like they're purchased from multiple different artists' character catalogs. There's just very little that visually ties them together.  The customization is equally annoying, the Devs charge you basically the same amount for in game currency as it would be to just pay for the full game and get the customization elements included. Not to mention the color customization system is ridiculously over complicated. Unlike Destiny, where you unlock a shader and can use it on any of your characters or armor, here, you unlock a shader and then have to assign it to specific skin. It can only be assigned to one skin, and then you either have to buy it again or unlock it again, and good luck doing the latter. Also, shaders in this game are not complete color schemes and designs like in Destiny, it's individual colors and materials that have to be assigned individually to various skin elements. Which would not be an issue if they were relatively easy to come by (they're not).  The upgrade systems in this game are also overly complicated. It seems like every element of your character is somewhat upgradeable, but you need to loot tons of materials and there are too many materials to keep track of that do too many things. The game Devs oddly chose this section to put an increased amount of effort into, but seemed to fall short with explaining how things work. The upgrade materials are all named weird things that don't explain what they are, what they do, or what they're for. It's just not user friendly. It's like the game Devs locked themselves in a room for a week and continuously railed adderall and just obsessed about creating an overly complicated upgrade system.  Basically, it costs you nothing but time and memory space to get this game. But even that price seems too high for what you get.",Not Recommended,2024.10.26,9.1

The game-play feels very fun, especially while zipping around with a grappling hook. It should be easy to recommend a friend, right? No. I personally can't recommend this game for its shady monetization practices. Examples of this would be overcharging for skins that are recolors, having a loot box for dyes that are one use, making their premium currency packs slightly lower than the items in the store, and having mod slots only available for real money, among other important game mechanics. I understand the game is free to play and I don't have problems with buying skins. I just feel like the way this game goes about it is greedy.

Beaten the campaign multiple times throughout those betas and played most of the characters (not any of the new ones on release). I could only handle around 10 hours of it after launch. It's more or less the same thing its been over the past few years with changes that no one wanted who played the beta and things that we WANTED the devs to change they didn't bother changing. Just going to make an easy straight to the point review:  Positives: -All characters feel different (ability wise) so there is someone for each kind of player -Easy to get mods to start build crafting very early -An automated matchmaking system in the open world and dungeons (coming soon match making in hard dungeons) -If you have a high end PC the game looks pretty good one of the better look UE5 games on the market -Quite a bit of choices for weapons to use (Even though a lot of them feel ripped from other games more on that later) -Has crossplay that works flawlessly  Negatives: -Terrible crafting system similar to warframe just to try and entice people to drop money to speed up the crafting progress (that includes crafting weapons, and characters, and support items) Here is an example from the hub:  -Stupid amount of grinding to get said weapon blue prints and character blue prints (heres an example to get ultimate character from the hub: )  -The new dye system is only good for people willing to drop real money. Dyes are randomized and one time use. -Gameplay loop is barebones you basically get the whole loop within first couple hours -Theres nothing really to do once you get all the characters (or all the characters you want) -Pricing in the cash shop is typical Nexon (overpriced) -Ultimate characters DO have an advantage over their normal character counterparts. They have better stat scaling. They are expensive to get with real money (the cost of a new triple A game) -Story is bland and boring (what else can you expect from an mmo) -The game doesn't properly teach players how to build their characters or that you should have one of each element (or elemental based weapons) for harder content. -They don't plan on changing the grind or their business model -Controls are some how a little less responsive then they were in the last beta -There's quite a few resources that they don't exactly explain what they do or where to get them. -A lot of the gun's models and sounds were directly ripped from games like Destiny and Warframe (even icons for mods are icons used in destiny).  Link for the icons they ripped and slightly altered from destiny:  Another link that talks about other assets taken:  As you can tell there are more negatives outside of the positives but most people who play are just blinded by the character models and basic third person gunplay. Give it a try if you haven't already but don't expect much from it. Expect to see what the game has to offer within first couple hours.

This game currently has a ridiculous amount of issues and it genuinely isn't worth your time until there are massive sweeping changes. The boss battles that they force you to play in order to progress are heavily overtuned, the things you can buy are horribly overpriced and blatantly pay-to-win, and the mechanics for grinding required materials are extremely complicated and infuriating. If you're thinking of joining in on the game, I'd suggest giving it a long time before you do to see if they actually make the game worth playing, or if it's dead on arrival.

The first descendant,Coffee☕,"Fascinating story and great gameplay for the first several hours of progression, but I quickly started anticipating the same content for each new area. The loops tended to get repetitive. The story loses itself somewhat and I started disengaging with it after the run-in with Jeremy.  The UI is confusing with lots of hidden sub-menus. The progression for weapons and Descendants is convoluted. There's no explanation for the prestige mechanic at level 40, so I had to guess at it.  Almost anything premium can be farmed, but expect a psychotic RNG to ruin your hopes. Expect premium content to be way overpriced, including consumable paints. I don't think its worth the investment until evaluating the first season.  I didn't find friends in this game. Maybe it was bad luck, but I frequently encountered players that trolled chat if I wasn't playing at peak skill performance. Not very clear social management tools and blocking ability.

The first descendant,CloudXII,"Product received for free  EDIT After reaching endgame.  Pros: - Good gunplay - Good movement - Boobas and Buttocks - Beautiful map design - Grind gets easy in the later stages of the game.  Cons : - It gets stale just like any other looter shooter. - Performance still spikes in certain missions. - Devs still cant decide the identity of this game. - Elemental damage doesnt feel impactful unlike games of the same genre (Warframe,Destiny2)  Rant: Personally i find the gameplay loop in endgame quite alright if compared to Warframe and Destiny 2. If i were to rank the gameplay i would put it in between Warframe and Destiny simply because the grind is easier than the former. Farming for Kuiper gets easier in Hard Mode (if you manage to full kit Bunny of course) and getting potatos and formas is much easier than Warframe.  ================================= Pros: - Good gunplay - Good movement - Boobas and Buttocks - Beautiful map design  Cons : - Quite the unoptimized game. random crashes time to time. Doubt anyone running the game with 6 year old hardware will ever find playing this game at <60fps enjoyable. - Enemies move too fast at times so good luck trying to make that shot count. (to my knowledge this isnt a problem with aim asist) - Too many level 10 mods. Spending Kuiper is an ultimatum. (currency to level mods up) - Identity crisis.

This would be manageable with a tank or damage setup with life leach. However, even with optimal damage output, the boss often returns to its immortal state after losing minimal health.

You better prepare a load of timegated resources, and then re-level this character about 8-10 times to get a full potential. Which is slow and BORING. Same for weapons.  You want to try this new character and weapons on challenging content? Or just shoot stuff and throw cool abilities at your enemies? Well you can try Defensive operation, and then either afk whole game if you have certain character in your team, or play alone, because other players came to leech, and you are not a Bunny (sucks to be you haha), so they will leave right away, or be completely useless and leave after.

The first descendant,Zaedyn,"Even if it is free to play, if you have some experience playing online games, this game will be a huge let down. Everything is extremely shallow and irrelevant. You don't really need the things you grind hours for, but hey it's looking good. You will hit the wall of; ""What do I do now...?"" pretty fast. Now that the 1rst season started. the only thing added was a SOLO quest to unlock the new character. They don't encourage teamplay, they seem to encourage solo mentality in a multiplayer setting....which I despite a lot. A lot of things you will have to do is : stand there and wait for the respawns...kill everything easily mindlessly in 10 seconds, repeat. Dungeons are pretty much the same, like in FF14. You just run to the end and kill. I think Destiny 2 nailed the gameplay for dungeons, they should do like them instead of just putting logos plagiarized from Destiny 2 to make you think the dungeons are as intricate. I never read the logos and they never affected my dungeons runs, whatever descendant, weapon or build Im using. It's a bit ridicule how many features in the game are like that. They are just there because it's there in other games ? Also, you can pay to unlock every character (which is the only freaking thing to do in this game). What you normaly pay for in a game is far from what we want as gamer consumers. So many games let you customize your character, they make it EXTREMELY expensive and you will be pissed with your purchases. They willingly design stuff to make you buy stuff later. They didnt put the color black at the beggining, but they put a dark blue that ressemble black....Now with season 1, they added the color black. So NOW you WILL buy the color black that you wanted in the first place. They KNOW this, and it's pissing me off that developpers take the gamers as consumers.",Not Recommended,2024.08.31,403.0

The first descendant,macandeli,"Introduction  Let get this out of the way first, I loved this game. I do not hate this game in anyway, but it does have some aspects that I very much despise, which is why I am discouraging anyone from playing this game. Before we get to the negative lets get the positives out of the way.  Positives  This game is the first game of this looter shooter genre that I have ever played and I absolutely loved it. Mowing down enemies was fun, and going through all the campaign missions was a very pleasant experience. I like how the two characters I had unlocked felt to play and using the combinations of their abilities was very fun. This game does get repetitive (the campaign mainly consists of the same few missions being reused), but I don't mind doing the same things over and over as long as the action itself is fun. This game also has pretty good graphics in my opinion and was pretty cool to look at. Overall the campaign was quite enjoyable and if you are to play the game I would recommend just playing the campaign, it is quite fun.  Negatives  Part One: The Grind  I would like to say I love games that give you a good grind. Spending hours doing the same thing over and over can get boring, but I believe the reward at the end of the grind and the feeling of accomplishment makes it all worth. I love a fun grind, but that's the problem with this game, a lot of the grinds aren't enjoyable at all. So in The First Descendant there are different characters that all have different abilities, strengths and weakens, so on and so forth. Since this is a free to play game they give you the option of buying them with real money, witch I don't have a problem with. What I do have a problem with is how to unlock them with without spending real money. In order to unlock a character for free you have to do a very long grind in order to get the materials. Now normally I would welcome such a grind, but the type of grind is the problem. In order to get what you want more often then not you have to do a type of mission that has a five minute cooldown on that specific server. So once someone has completed the mission everyone else on that server has to wait five minutes in order to try it again in order to get a CHANCE at getting the lootbox type item that you would have to open up by doing ANOTHER mission in order open the lootbox and have an EVEN SMALLER chance of getting the material you want for the character you wish to get. Now I don't necessarily have a problem with doing multiple missions just to have a chance at getting what I want, what I have a problem with is the five minute time. When I play the game I want to PLAY THE GAME. I don't enjoy going afk for five minutes and then spending one minute doing the mission and then waiting five minutes again and repeating the cycle. You may be thinking: ""wait, if the five minute timer is only for the server can't you hop over to a different server so you don't have to wait five minutes?"" You would be right in thinking that, but so would everyone else. Everyone else is server hopping too so it is difficult to find one that hasn't already been cleared, so you will still have to wait (although you won't have to wait as long as five minutes) for the mission to come back as well as spending a majority of your time staring at a loading screen for when you hop in between servers. Overall, I like to PLAY the games I play, not stare at a loading screen and go afk constantly, its not fun.  Part Two: Anti-Fun  I explained previously how the grind for a character isn't fun, and there are more cases of this like this throughout the game. In the game you have a wide variety of guns you can use, and you can modify these guns with mods you pick up form dead enemies. A cool part of the mod system is that you don't need to consume a mod for each and every gun. Basically, you can use the same mod for every gun within its ammo group (there are four different types of ammo). So if you upgrade one mod to its max level and it belongs to the general rounds category, you can put that same mod on every general rounds gun. Pretty cool system, right? WRONG. It would be a good system if the amount of mods you can hold wasn't limited and they didn't give you an ungodly amount of duplicate mods that hold almost NO PURPOSE besides just filling up your mod inventory. This feature is just stupid. Why have a carrying capacity on WEAPON MODS, and also give you many duplicated for no reason. Also I really HATE the bosses. They suck. It feels like instead of fighting against and triumphing over a great foe, you are trying to triumph over the 10 minute boss timer. I have lost more battles against the timer than the actual boss itself, and its not a good feeling. Its also doesn't feel very rewarding when you do manage to beat the boss, because all you felt like you beat WAS THE TIMER. I understand they do this in order to tell you to come back with stronger weapons, but why don't they just tell you this. Why let someone battle the boss in the first place if they are too weak? To waste their time? All this does is make the timer the real enemy, not the boss. This game has so many stupid mechanics and general lack of user friendliness for no apparent reason.  Why?  Why does Nexon make their game fun and then late make it bad and unfun? They could just be stupid, but I doubt it. They do it for the money. They make the game anti-fun in order for you to buy something to make it fun again. The campaign shows you the potential of what the game could be, but once its finished and you want to explore more of the game it fails in delivering a fun experience. I understand making character grinding not fun in order to make people buy them instead of grinding for them, but I don't agree with it. Why would I play a game where the developers MAKE THEIR GAME WORSE in order to get more sales. Why would I play this. There are so many self-respecting good games out there that try to give the players the best experience and actually want the players to have a good time that would be a much better use of your money. Don't give your money to company that makes their game worse in order to get you to buy something, because they will continue to do this same thing in the future and you will always be getting a downgraded game. Personally I would rather spend my money on a game I enjoy so that I can enjoy it more, not on a game I no longer enjoy. If you are going to play this game, just play the campaign, and I don't recommend giving them any money. I'm quite disapointed honestly, I really loved this game and its sad to let it go.

The first descendant,PrimedPiper,"Okay, so there is a bit of a caveat to this. I really like games that are immersive. Games where I get sucked in to the story and want to play because I want to find out what is going to happen next. This game has a very weak story line. More on that later. On the flip side, the game mechanics are great. It is fun using the grappling hook to zip around. It was fun playing, but I got bored real fast. It wasn't like there was a purpose to everything we are tasked to do. Sure there were missions and we were commanded by Alpha to do things, but it just felt like we did missions because we were told. Some of the mechanics were confusing in certain sections, but over all it was fine. Okay, so the reason I don't recommend this game is because it is boring. It felt like an attempt at being Warframe, Destiny, and Remnant From the Ashes. It has all the asthetics and structure of Warframe while it looks like Warframe and Destiny had a child and it sometimes plays like Warframe where it is easy, and then out of nowhere there will be challenges that are ridiculous and impossible to complete unless you rank up your weapons as if you were playing Remnant, which breaks the flow of the story because now you have to repeat missions you have already completed to rank up. Okay, the story just feels generic. Good guy with special abilities comes to save humanity, while evil man corrupts resources. The characters were somewhat ridiculous. Dr Kate looked like she just graduated high school, Karel reminds me of Darkseid from DC, Why do all the main female characters (except Nell) look like they have an Only Fans page? Bunny is just to poppy and exuberant, it got annoying. Jeremy, the classic blonde hair d0uch3 bag with a ridiculous mustache. Most of all, the story just didn't grab my attention. We were supposed to be looking for the iron hearts and I lost interest real fast. Anyway, I am glad people like it. If you are into that sort of thing, give it a try. After all, it's free.

If one of these things is a no go, a complete failure, they fail too. One example above all: Anthem. Generic design, buggy gameplay, trash loot. Ergo, an abject failure.  Then, TFD. I will be frank: there is not ONE aspect of the visual design of this game that isn't vomit-inducing. The over sexualization (WOMEN ONLY, OF COURSE, LOL) is nauseating not because it is vulgar or thirsty, but because it is tasteless. It shares with the rest of the game's art direction a radical absence of originality or even... hell, I dunno, identity. You can be sexy, scalding hot, but still not generic. TFD is just embarrassing, afraid as it is to dare to have a vision.  This is a rule for environments, character design, dialogues and all its visuals: so bland it actively kills your neurons. The few you have left, anyway.  What DOES remain? The story? The characterization? ...do you even have to ask? Let's just not go there, buddy. For both of our sakes. It's not gradable. Its world feels like a crappy engine demo from 2015.  The gameplay then. Mediocre. Animations are subtly woody, while the particle and light effects have the grit of a baked banana. Shooting is eh. Abilities are samey or useless. Most of all, you don't feel powerful. You feel like you are on a lawnmower simulator, endlessly cutting grass. Still, you can make that fun, but not TFD. TFD's grind is soul-crushing.  I will not speak about the farming. I've seen too little of it, because I'm not gonna play in depth this trash even if they pay me. Which they won't, because the developers are famous as the second coming of Micro transaction Satan. Just read around.  Stay away. Unless you have a terrible, terrible taste for the mediocre.

The first descendant,Dragano,"I played both betas for this game and was really looking forward to it but have been met with nothing but disappointment. This game has a lot of problems and the devs seem to be listening and slowly fixing things but it's not enough. It's like a combo of Destiny 2 and Warframe with some of what makes them good but a lot of their flaws as well.  CONS - Nexon - Super grindy for every little thing - Pretty easy until it's not the normal bosses get really hard pretty quick making it hard to progress since you have to fight each one once to progress the story. - Grappling is fun when it works half the time it won't grab especially on bosses or it will fling you off in weird directions or just let go early - Drop rates don't seem very accurate which Nexon has a history of incorrectly reporting drop rates - Pretty much all the areas are bland and boring to look at - The story and dialog are incredibly boring none of the VA's really seem like they want to be here - Stealth missions with only 1 stealth character in the game - Monetization is pretty high things are grossly over priced - Shaders (colors) are purchased individually and can only be used once and can't even be used on base skins (despite being able to do so in the beta) so you have to buy a skin to to use them on a descendant or gun and tough luck if your gun doesn't have a skin. - Game runs like sludge constant freezes, crashes, and stuttering just lags like crazy even on low settings I may not have a top of the line PC but it's not a potato either - A lot of Descendant skills are animation locked and really slow to cast leaving you vulnerable  PROS - Free to play - Kinda fun - all the characters are hot - lots of booty  Hopefully down the line once they have time to improve it will be better that is if Nexon doesn't just abandon it after a few months.",Not Recommended,2024.08.15,93.0

The first descendant,Ranen,"It's fun, but in a trashy kind of way that, at least so far, doesn't feel much more than a numbers-go-up bullet spray shooter. As many have mentioned, it combines a lot of the good elements of Warframe and Destiny. I don't have much experience with Destiny (I didn't enjoy it much), but I have a decade of Warframe experience. The elements taken from Warframe, namely the progression elements, are half-baked and feel unnecessary. Modding is fine, but the mastery rank stuff taken from Warframe feels pointless and just an excuse to use cruddy weapons. This happens in Warframe too, I won't lie, but the issue here is that the cruddy weapons you level up for mastery don't have significant differences, whereas in Warframe they tend to be wildly different and reward you for ""exploring"" all of the options. I've found some awesome weapons and frames, even if they're low tier, this way. In FD, it feels like exploring 10 versions of the same weapon. Lastly, the gameplay is very Destiny, with pretty mediocre action compared to Warframe, but that is a high bar to overcome considering Warframe's movement is next level.  Overall, at least in this state, I'd say go play Warframe if you like the progression, or go play Destiny if you like the... gunplay.  HOWEVER! One huge win is the Destiny-style emergent world events that feel very Guild Wars 2. This would go a long way to helping Warframe feel more MMO while maintaining its action.

One positive is I do like the Void Missions where you fight a boss with a group. The fights can be fun and challenging but they definitely lack substance. The missions are just as repetitive as Warframe but without the real difference in weapons and movement style of the game.

Otherwise, you're just constantly changing gear and weapons to fight the same enemies in the same 4 types of missons or the same boss fight arena. I don't understand not having PVP. It could be easily balanced in world tiers or gear score to make sure people who are overpowered do not get matched with each other. You should be able to test your build against other players.

The first descendant,Hawkins,"Nope. Just nope.  Yes, as many other reviewers have said, this game will remind you of Warframe and Destiny, if you've played those games. And I agree with many who say that TFD doesn't achieve this model nearly as well as either.  To be as fair as possible, here's what I liked:  - The art style is lovely, from the characters to the environments (when you stop shooting long enough to look around). There is certainly lots of creativity and love of the genre on display. - The bones of the game are solid...initially, there is lots to do and an acceptable amount of variety. - The UI is pretty (never discount the value of this aspect). - The feel and sound of the guns are solid; they're fun to fire. - In general, the matchmaking is solid, mostly for the individual missions (it falls off dramatically when playing intercepts).  Unfortunately, that's about where the joy ends and the torment begins.  - I want to say this before I say anything else: if a game forces me to flee to Google in order to understand its base systems, it has already failed in my book. I don't need to be led by the hand down every single path, but a game MUST explain its own boundaries, systems, and expectations. This game does a lousy job of that (see more details below).  - The dialogue is pure pain, filled with awkward performances and even more awkward grammar. I found myself skipping it, not only because I didn't care about a single word anyone was saying, but because it made little sense and was agonizing to listen to. (Bunny's flashbacks were a real low point. I liked her until I heard her miserable, incessant, spoiled whining.)  - The crafting system in ridiculously punishing and, like most of the games internal systems, needlessly confusing. In order to enhance a gun, I have to create a copy of that gun?! Wow. Spoiler alert...it's almost impossible to find the mats to create that second gun...which is itself a mat.  - The module system is similarly confusing. I am never able to perceive any benefit from the modules I equip. I just choose the defaults, never knowing why the game picked them, and go on my merry way. So, as apparently robust as this module system is, I basically ignore it. Likewise when upgrading modules...what does that actually do, because I can promise you this...it doesn't make me feel more powerful.  - The game provides horrible feedback about what materials you need. You have to drill down into an item, try to remember where to find it, go to that spot and do that activity, and MAYBE get the material (others have already noticed that the drop rates are ridiculously low, on average). Another example? I earned the first three base Descendants. I'd love to get more, but the game makes it SO confusing as to how to go about that. You have to find and craft materials, but finding out which ones and then finding them is nothing more than a brutal chore. It's neither fun nor satisfying, both things a game should be.  - Oh, how I HATE the intercept missions!!! Follow me on this journey: you enter matchmaking. You get paired up with people, but you have no idea why you were matched with those specific players, nor whether they are suited for this mission. You try to beat the stupid boss. You fail...and you have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHY. Were you under-powered? Did you not have the right weapons? Something else? Just as bad, let's say by some miracle you beat the boss. You walk over to the big green blob, only to be told you get no rewards. You are not told why. Just horrible, horrible game design.  - After the main story, you have to switch to hard mode to get any decent rewards, However, hard mode is BRUTAL when playing solo. One enemy can one-shot my shields. Stupid. And that brings us to grinding. There is good, fun grinding and bad, pointless grinding. I played for about an hour last night. Do you know the outcome? Absolutely nothing. I played, I died, I got nothing I needed, and I had a lousy time. Bad grinding.  - The Battlepass is typical 21st century greed in all its ugliness. Why in the world would I care about useless cosmetics when I can't even craft a proper weapon? I bought the Premium upgrade simply to support the developers, but this game will never extract another penny from me. It's caused me an extraordinary amount of disappointment and frustration. Make a FUN game and you'll see how quickly that translates into me paying for it.  - There's so much more I could say. I wanted to like this game but it gets in its own way far too often. I'm glad I tried it, but very sorry that I invested so much time in it. Ultimately, it didn't warrant or deserved that investment.  I will repeat my gaming mantra for any devs willing to listen. Before a game is anything else, IT SHOULD BE FUN. I play to relax, and yes, after a miserable day at work, I play to feel empowered and successful.

Half the playerbase has already quit and I imagine this kind of thing does it. Also there is no support forum no place to put in a ticket. Some key mods dont even work, but if a streamer or youtuber doesn't mention it, good luck reporting the issue. Wait till they change the drop rate on activator blueprints before you play this",Not Recommended,2024.08.04,460.3

The map is quite large, however, it is completely bland, empty, boring, I am used to games of this type being a reasonably repetitive playable loop, however this one is terrible it is like 10 times more repetitive than Warframe, there are only 2 types of missions or at least in the 4 hours that I played, kill enemies that appear on the map with a secondary objective or defeat a boss, that's all, the characters' abilities are also very boring, unoriginal, bunny is like volt mixed with gauss after a car accident, the mission icons are identical to those of destiny 2, the systems that the game has are identical to those of warframe, it is an amalgam of things that give a product much worse than the aforementioned games and personally I feel that something like with Nier Automata happens, if the characters were not so attractive nobody would play it.",Not Recommended,2024.07.30,3.6

Could potentially be due to K series power issue with dx12.  I finally managed to get it started by underclocking my cpu and boy do i have a review for you.  This game is a mix of Warframe, Destiny and probably Division at the same time but it seems to have taken all the worst features and combined them. The weapon although varied, doesn't feel have enough punch to it. The skills for the heroes also not that good compared to both Warframe and Destiny 2 either from the visual effect of it and the actually in-game effect. You end up running out of ammo and it become tedious during fights, especially during the uninspired boss fights. Most bosses are boring and generic, the fights themselves feel like theres no stake and you already start getting bored veryyy quickly. Your character relies on mana to use skills in addition to cooldowns. The problem is, you run out of mana very quickly. This combined with bullet sponge unresponsive bosses means youre just running back and forth between resupply drones.  The enemies in general also seem terrible. Using destiny as an example, you have the vex,fallen,taken and each of them have their own unique flair and weaknesses. In this game you have generic monster number 1, generic ranged monster number 2 etc. I cant explain how boring this game is in comparison to others.

The first descendant,Yes Man,"If you are going to copy Warframe and Destiny 2, at least bring some good boss fight mechanics. I've fought 2 bosses (not including Grave Walker) and that is it for me. They have annoying invincibility orbs and energy shields plus friggin tons of health to top it off. Toughing up mechanics and large health bar doesn't make the game challenging, it makes the game boring and even more annoying to play. Other players might argue that it's a looter-shooter, bosses are supposed to be bullet sponges. However I've played plenty of looter-shooters (i.e. division 2, borderlands series, Warframe) and sure they have bullet sponges but they are in the later stage of the game where players, by that point, should have accumulated substantial gears to face them. The First Descendant throws these bosses at early stages and it causes a burnout.  The game also has features that have been seen in other online games out there like Warframe's upgrade system i.e. Modding Systems, Mastery Rank, Forma, Prime variance. I am OK with that, little inspirations from other games are fine. This game, with all that awesome systems inspired by other games, still falls short on gameplay.  Gunplay feels really weak like shooting at marsh mellow and ammo economy is horrid. If you are having Destiny 2's ammo system, at least add increased ammo drop rate. Grappling hook is nothing new but it helps with mobility which could have had sliding as well.  Overall, can't really recommend this game. bland gameplay, terrible boss fight mechanics, If developers really think that having good looking character design can compensate for gameplay, think again.",Not Recommended,2024.07.03,4.4

The first descendant,Satoshi,"Nothing much to see here. It's just yet another soulless title from an Asian developer that follows the recent trend of copying popular games. This time, it's a mix of multiple popular looter shooters.  At the beginning, the game greets you with a bland cinematic. It tries so hard to give the player some goosebumps but fails to deliver anything other than the basic idea of the game's lore.  Then, the game presents you with an illusion of free choice. 3 incredibly generic characters to choose from, and I didn't feel an immediate connection with any of them, except the 4th bunny girl in the distance who's, of course, unavailable. Checking out the screenshots, seems like most people are playing as the silver-haired woman, and it just looks so cheap to see clones running all around the local social area. I can go on and on and on about what the lack of proper character customization tells about how the developer sees their playerbase, but let's just go further down the game's tutorial.  The first ""fight"" with bots shows that weapon handling in this game is pretty much non-existent. It feels like it was designed for mobile devices. Compared to Warframe, the guns have no weight, no meaningful recoil, and no visual and auditory feedback when the projectiles hit the enemy. Just hold LMB like you hold your finger against the touchscreen and be happy, or else... With the game being a shooter, seeing this pretty much settled my opinion about the game.  A few minutes later, the game crashed when I tried to skip a cutscene.

While it's true that the game has not released since long, the available cast offers very little variation, the gunplay gets stale soon enough, the grind isn't even trying to make it fun (unlike warframe where you can chill mostly or get used to it), in this game it is a full fledged chore, with bad ratios, possibly on purpose, and the story content is absolutely filler-ish, hardly anything remarkable.  OST has very little variation aswell, you'll soon realize you may aswell just turn on your own music anyway  TL;DR If you gotta play a game like this one, go for Destiny 2 or Warframe, as this game has a bit of those, but it just can't reach same potential, being not bad in se, but just average at most.

The first descendant,Z3R0 von Degurechaff,"I got no idea if the boss designs improve past... What, the third boss you face during the main story? But so far it has just been ""Elite enemy but multiple health bars and if you deplete one, you need to shoot floating balls to get rid of their immortality"". That's the bosses I've encountered in the main story, not a single unique one, just your run of the mill standard enemy copy-pasted and then a ""boss mechanic"" copy-pasted on. Oh, and the balls respawn if you don't shoot them fast enough, even if you get all three before any respawn, you can get all three down but because you were a second or two too slow, they respawn. Absolutely lazy design. (The Void Interception bosses are at least unique in their designs and far more fun than the story bosses)  The Vanguard enemies are even more egregious of an offense for me. If you have two of them and one of them does their stunning move that knocks you down against a wall, they can just team up on you and stunlock you, never moving further away or closer to do a different attack, just standing there at their mid-range and keeping you there while slowly whittling your health and shield away with no way for you to escape. How did this get past QA? How did nobody encounter this in the public playtests and if people did AND reported it, why did it get ignored? No game should have stunlock in it without a way out of it.  The voice-acting for the characters and their dialogue is also ""meh"" at the best of times, most frequently I found myself just taking my headset off so I wouldn't hear the dialogue, because it didn't really add anything for me, it was instead annoying. Just listen to ""Alpha"" talk in the first 2 hours of the game, I'd rather read an in-game email instead of hearing dialogue from that NPC.  Don't get me wrong, this game has some fun mechanics, but the downsides for me are too much. Give the game a try if games like Destiny or Warframe are your thing.

One hilarious example is that one of the starting characters literally has two shield abilities that functionally do the exact same thing, except they have a slightly different shape. The gunplay is meh as well, both Warframe and Destiny have more satisfying and unique weapons with better shooting mechanics to back it up.  Don't even get me started on how bad the AI is.

Drop chances to get a ""relic"" that has a piece you need is at 20 percent then the piece you need is more than likely at a 6 percent drop chance. The way to get the equivalent of a warframe Forma also involves multiple pieces at low drop rates and a horrible mini game which you can fail.

After 60 hours, my friend and I have reached the end of the 4th area and are unable to progress yet due to the difficulty of the Dead Bride colossus even in public lobbies. The entirety of our gameplay now is repetitive grinding for small chances at gaining new things and trying to upgrade the things we have and we are really struggling to keep up the depressing monotony of it just to be able to continue making progress.  I keep thinking how similar it is to those other games but how they do everything in a cheaper or easier to work with way than it is done in this game.

I have played dozens of MMORPGs, so I am very used to the grind, but it didnt feel like the grind pays off in this game. The story is boring beyond belief, i played through 3 hours of the story and found myself skipping the cutscenes almost immediately. The quests are boring and consist of doing the same thing over and over again, and the missions that had other players was ruined by how many higher level players oneshotting everything before I could even look at the enemies. I cant say much about the end game because I refuse to go through 20hrs of mind numbing slop to do those same mission on Hard difficulty or do their bosses. Nothing special in this game to set it apart from the large amount of looter shooter options out there.

Like okay, they look high quality, but they look so bland. They feel empty. Imagine coming from a game like Warframe where you play as something called Nekkros or Excalibur, then coming to this game to play as some dude named Kyle or freakin Enzo. I don't mean to compare the two btw. Its just... So disappointing. This is coming from someone who needs the character I'm playing as to be fleshed out aesthetically and storywise btw.

Like, genuinely, they are clearly trying to make something inspired by Destiny and Warframe and really just fail at capturing the appeal of either. The gameplay is mushy and boring, the shooting is bland, the enemies are slow and predictable, at no point in my 2.7 hours of play did I feel challenged in any fashion and mostly just stood in the open clicking heads.  The loot was bland and uninteresting, the weapons just looking for higher numbers to replace what I currently had. They had some module system clearly inspired by the mods in Warframe but they did nothing interesting and didn't alter gameplay in any fashion besides making numbers go higher.  Also, for a modern 'AAA' game, it looks like complete trash, like genuinely there are PS3 games that look better. All the graphics are mushy and the antialiasing seems trash.

The first descendant,NanoBurger,"Alright listen, I don't do reviews normally, much less negative ones but in this case I felt compelled to share my experience. As you may have gathered from my total playtime, I found this game to be essentially unplayable on my system, though I was able to survive the compiling shaders boss that claimed other reviewers before me. This, brings me to my first major point against this game, the system requirements this game lists seem... off. Now let me be clear my specs are not top of the line by any stretch, in fact they were almost exactly in line with the recommended system requirements. Great, should be able to run this thing without much issue. Oh, there were issues alright. In my brief time actually attempting to play this thing it crashed to the desktop out of nowhere at least twice and the easy anti-cheat was responsible for one outright bsod. and all the while running this game made my graphics card sound like it was doing its best jet engine impression. This leads me to believe that this game clearly wasn't optimized for the Intel Arc series of cards, so if you dear reader happen to have one of these cards as well, you'd do well to heed my warning. In my, maybe half hour of playing, I couldn't even get out of the tutorial area without it crashing and that to me is frankly baffling.   Oh and one last point, this game makes you install two kernel-level anti-cheats, the Easy anti-cheat as I mentioned above as well as Nexon's own homemade anti-cheat. In addition to that you have to agree to Nexon's privacy policy, EULA, and the third party sale of your data before they even let you start the game up.

Even the level design feels unoriginal. Just like Destiny, you start off jumping from some black cubes to some other black cubes while aliens stand around.  The grappling hook is kind of cool, I guess, but everything else just feels like a poor copycat of a thousand other games.  I played until the first boss, which had its own tutorial explaining how it likes to twerk in ""resistance"" or something, and you were supposed to hold on to it (or its wiggling bits? not really sure).

There is a 32gb patch right now. So I've finished work and want to play to see if it gets better as you progress and sat waiting. Actually I'm not now as going to play something else. If your looking for something mindless, with a heavy grind to level up characters or you like to drop large sums of money to create whale accounts for your stream. This game is perfect for you. I would of liked to give it another session to see if it changed my mind, but I suspect this constant updates and patching will be a regular thing, which isn't ideal for those of us who just want to play some games after work.

Then you need a lot of HP and defense, and a really strong gun.  This game became Destiny 2.  Update: S1 release has definitely lost the uniqueness this game had.

The first descendant,VictorLobby,"with detailed environments and visual effects that truly capture the player's attention. The game's aesthetics are one of its strongest points, providing a visually pleasing experience.  When it comes to gameplay, ""The First Descendant"" offers a third-person shooter experience with its ups and downs. The combat can feel clunky at times, which may frustrate players looking for a smoother experience. However, the characters' abilities help to compensate for this rigidity, adding a strategic and enjoyable layer to the game.  Unfortunately, the voice acting leaves much to be desired. The characters' voices often sound forced and unnatural, which can break the player's immersion. Additionally, the game's story is quite clichéd, following the formula of many other space shooter games. There are few surprises or innovations in the narrative, which may disappoint those looking for something new and original.  Another negative point is the game's community, which can be quite toxic. This can make the gaming experience less enjoyable, especially for new players. It is also notable that many players opt to use the same ""hot woman"" skin, creating a bizarre and repetitive visual pattern. This lack of diversity in skin choices can be seen as a reflection of the game's community and their preferences.  The enemies in the game do not present a significant challenge, which can take the excitement out of battles. The lack of good bosses is another weak point, as epic battles against memorable bosses are often what distinguish a good game from an excellent one.  In summary, ""The First Descendant"" is a beautiful game with great graphics and solid gameplay, but it is hampered by poor voice acting, a clichéd story, unchallenging enemies, and a toxic community. The repetition of skins and the lack of impressive bosses are also negative points that contribute to a less diverse and interesting gaming experience. If you are looking for a visually impressive game with enjoyable gameplay, it might be worth checking out, but be prepared to deal with these negative aspects.",Not Recommended,2024.01.18,0.5

If you fall in love with the basic character you choose at the beginning I'm sure it's great, but otherwise it's not really rewarding. You pretty much get stonewalled into investing into a base character or spending money.  The free to play grind seems to be deliberately unrewarding, bc game developers made certain materials locked behind competing activities (example a reactor and two outposts drop a specific material. Normally you farm outposts to get patterns and use reactors to unlock them. The outposts don't match the reactor, so you can't use any of the patterns and also get the materials).  So, just go into it with eyes open. It's incredibly short lived in terms of clear positives, unless you pay into it.

The first descendant,TwinDenis,"Intense Lag during the first barely 20 minutes of game-play intro, the cut-scene before the hub literary was 5 fps on a well optimized system... the game is not very well optimized obviously. Not recommended unless you own an RTX or something close to that, and still I would need to test and see if that's the case. Other than that not much to say, couldn't play much more beyond that so that's the experience I will base the review from until they fix the game. But yes it felt like Warframe meets Destiny in its own way, however gun-play was not as engaging or impactful, it feels like the developers do not know what makes a good game... well... good. Graphics look decent but for a game of 2024 this is to be expected, however for the performance cost it is definitely not worth it, other games look way better and run miles and miles smoother.  EDIT: After careful analysis it turns out that the issue is related to players being nearby, all settings were set to low and yet the issue was the same, At medium settings and no people around the game ran just fine, not perfect but fine, with players it was unplayable, not all players but some.  The game Runs and plays worse than Warframe which is a game they got ""inspired"" from whilst having a ton of monetization so early in so imagine later on.  This review will change when this gets addressed since the game cannot be played with other players even though it is multiplayer.  EDIT July 2024: I did get Geforce Now Ultimate to be able to play this game, it runs well, given 50ms or so its pretty accurate, on lower rigs from Nvidia it wouldnt run well and would clock at around 45-50fps, but considering those cards are RTX 2060 minimum, well yeah that is not ""most people's"" hardware, I noticed the game loads EVERYTHING on a world area at once, and certain events on an AREA trigger shader load calls from your PC constantly. With Geforce Now Ultimate it ran at about 120fps no problem, with frame generation even higher, but I rather have a stable connection, gotta use reflex for that to feel responsive. I did that to make a real review and be able to run the game properly. So far, the game feels fun to play, but its very grindy and most cosmetics are locked behind paywalls and generally the game is loaded with micro-transactions, you can also pay to progress way faster. The Gun-Play feels okay, can be fun at times but there is not much diversity in weapons as I would have expected like there is from other similar games. Mission types are also very monotonic and will feel repetitive after a while. The only benefit from playing this over another similar free game (Warframe) would be that missions are all in one big area, other than that and the very high demands for hardware, not really anything else. Character Abilities feel alright, but not all are exciting, also its unclear how to get more characters for free, I chose Ajax, he is the protector-tank of the roster. There is also Bunny (electric user, runs fast etc). IF you have an RTX 3070 or above, you may play this game and is definitely recommended at least for a try, otherwise it is a skip and I hard-recommend warframe over this. I hope this helps.",Not Recommended,2024.07.06,18.4

Do you enjoy doing the same thing with every weapon in the game? Well this is the game for you!! Of course you can pay an astronomical amount to get things done faster but at the end, you're still playing the same missions and fighting the same bosses.  You can do this twice for the regular characters and the ultimate characters which is pointless. If you get an ultimate character, why can't you just morph the regular into the ultimate and get your stats up higher?  I'm not a stranger to farming either since I play Diablo and played all of the Borderlands games for years but this one just feels way too repetitive for no reason other than trying to get you to spend 100 dollars on an ultimate character only to turn around and do the same missions to level it up then fight the same bosses.  I am enjoying the skins but that's not enough to keep me playing. The only redeeming thing about this game is that I didn't spend any money which I would be willing to give the devs some coin if the prices weren't so ridiculously high.

The first descendant,"""LargerRanger5""164.95Mhz[750mW]","don't get me wrong, I like the idea, i like the execution. this game feels like a love-child between Destiny, and warframe.... the reason I can't recommend this (beyond the ridiculous microtransactions which for this company is just par for the course)... i cannot recommend this game because even though i have a fairly good gaming setup, this game demands too much power from your machine. it has actually fried my power supply, and I've had to order a new one...EVEN THEN, this game is so demanding on power it caused my machine to short out....graphics wise if my setup can handle warframe, then it should be able to handle this, so I don't know WHAT is in this game that sucks up power like a hummer sucks up gas, but they need to SERIOUSLY work on this game into a workable state that won't take out my power..... this development team forgets not everyone can dish out the funds for a top-tier gaming PC....  Overall.... if you feel like playing circuit roulette, this games for you, but until they add power requirements to the store page, and a serious update reducing the draw issue....i cannot recommend this game.",Not Recommended,2024.07.22,5.8

The first descendant,TuggSpeedman,"While the game is charming in the beginning, it becomes rather daunting once you reach the end-game portion. This is, without a doubt, a grind-or-get-lost type of game. It has characteristics similar to Warframe but with more grind and way less inspiring characters. The descendants you can choose from all feel rather worthless, while the descendant Bunny is the only one whose abilities actually feel like they do anything. The remaining descendants are nearly worthless as their abilities have long cooldowns and don't really feel powerful, to begin with.  The gunplay is the best part of the game, but not nearly on the level of Warframe. Warframe at least explores the power fantasy of using weapons, whereas this game's weapons are mostly single-target with a few exceptions.  I don't recommend investing anymore time than I have.",Not Recommended,2024.07.20,32.3

I think this is a standard Korean way, I definitely don't feel the same about some other game's conversations when play them. Not saying other games got Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones level of writing but this is way below. Cons: Been there done that, nothing NOTHING is original here.  I wasted ten minutes on it, entered the main city. Tried to get into the story, but it's very basic, and the game devs. should do everything to grasp my attention in the first 10 minutes, but they failed miserably.
