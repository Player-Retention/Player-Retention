sentence,topic
no warframe doesnt have raid like destiny does it used to have back then but its too hectic and hard to understand so dev decide to pull it off and redesign it properly maybe in the future warframe might have raids  is warframe pay to win,1
yes and no warframe is easy to get into but its hard to understand not to mention to master the modding system in the game this is why even till these day people will argue about builds and how some mods work,1
is warframe repetitive,1
yes every looter shooter is repetitive my suggestion is take the game slow enjoy at your own pace leave if you want and come back when you feel like it,-1
why warframe design is so weird,1
sadly warframe isnt as sexualised as the first descendant so for you coomer out there it might disappoint you,1
what is that kid and guy i saw people playing in warframe why cant i be them,1
sadly pvp in warframe is dead and its awful if youre into pvp destiny and division does it better  i saw people playing warframe in an open world environment is it an open world game,26
no its not only a certain area has an open world view but its not a true open world game so if youre into a true open world game this is not your cup of tea,2
hours in and i dont know what im doing really im having fun but i have no idea what im doing,-1
what is this game even warframe is a third person pve loot shooter where its about collecting resources and items to craft new guns and armor so you can kill things in more ways,-1
its as if the game says look i get it you dont wanna work to get that shotgun but its gonna cost you quite a bit to buy it the main you will be buying is instead things like weapon slots warframe slots boosters accessories and so on,1
sometimes its not so bad other times it goes a beyone extreme,-1
if games with grinding doesnt suit you at all maybe you wanna skip this one,3
im currently perma banned and i still recommend this game,-1
why all the frames got so much ass,-1
if you dont have a job and no money then this game is for you,5
ive played for  hours and understand nothing,0
you need to be on crack to understand the gameplay and marijuana to understand the story,12
whenever i boot this mf up my real life comes to a halt for several weeks until i burn out only to start the cycle again,-1
please dont rate this review so i can forget about it peacefully,6
not pay to win before i start my review i want to dispell this notion,24
anyone who tells you this game is pay to win is wrong or lying to you,24
youre blindsiding yourself if youre going to make the argument that this game is pay to win,24
if you dont like grinding or mmotype games warframe probably isnt for you,1
i would still give it a go even if you dont like those types of games but youre probably not going to enjoy it if you arent a patient person,0
if you dont like the fact that you arent guaranteed certain things and have to wait for warframes and weapons to finish building before you can use them or that you have to farm resources to build them then you probably wont enjoy the game,1
list of things that actually happen in this game  you collect the exploded parts of a mathematician who blew himself up trying to perform a domain expansion ceo of a planetary sector fatally wounds a homeless child after harassing them for a comic book,14
bring cross save i have over k hours on ps and i cant start again pleaseeeeee,-1
yeah its grindy,3
i might be schizophrenic because there is a woman talking in my head every  seconds,0
then one day youll be going about your life and suddenly all neuron function will cease and only one synapse will fire,0
dispense with the idea that warframe is free  that aspect is entirely irrelevant free or not a bad game is still bad and certainly not worth a damn,1
this game certainly demands time investment and that aspect can put off new players that are expecting to progress at a rapid pace,-1
its hard to make a perfect game impossible in fact but warframe certainly pushes some boundaries,1
theres no denying that it starts off slow,-1
now it is not without its downsides,-1
it is rare to face a bug that truly causes major problems,2
graphical optimisation isnt great especially with the open world maps,-1
dont shy away because you think youll be bottle necked into buying your way to progress it is never the case,-1
this game is not for everyone,0
if grindy games are not for you i would reccomend you at least try warframe but if you get bored and leave id understand,1
i would say an  out of  solely for the point that it is still seminiche as a looter grindy game and that not everything is intuitive and has a decent learning curve,3
pros free isnt destiny good devs isnt made by bungie space mom  cons  hours gone,9
grind for a disgusting amount of time,3
send help,0
im not sure how i feel about the game yet ill check back in another  hours,0
this cant be right,0
fifth week  hours i have a problem,0
how to ruin your life   download warframe  learn how to press buttons on your keyboard to play warframe  grind for hundreds and thousands of hours for that one thing that looks really cool,1
congratulations you now have no life,0
lets overgeneralize a bit  game has big guns that go pew pew or brrap brrap or psssssssssssshhhh that kill enemies to varying degrees,8
so  hours of having warfarm launched and i still havent spent a penny its about the statement now,1
do you want to do things over and over and over again without any purpose,0
i swear im gonna drink one gallon of water every time someone finds this helpful this review is anything but helpful,-1
been playing this game off and on for  years only leaving because its so hard not to play other games,0
i have not seen the sun in months,0
and yet without the grind i have nothing,3
i am weary sick beaten down utterly devoid of all that is good in this world,-1
the tutorial is very pretty but is so laughably bad at teaching you the mechanics of the game it almost feels like a dated meme,4
want to be permainvisible and nail everybody with a bow and arrow,8
this is both good and bad,0
bad becausethere is always something to do,-1
warframe is not a game you can beat,1
its a slow burn,-1
if you try to binge or rush this you are gonna have a subpar experience,-1
but it also has one the worst but prettiest tutorials i have ever seen,4
run you fools,-1
free to play only costs your soul,9
i wish i never played this game,0
if you have a life do not allow this freetime black hole this time succubus to consume you,0
you will hate it yourself and everyone who plays it and youll still be farming,11
its too late for you,0
miserable timesink cant stop playing send help,0
no matter what anyone says this game isnt a pay to win game,24
took me whole  hours to find the first toxic player,0
i can not belive i wasted money on destiny and destiny  when this game exsisted,5
i had a small wee wee no friends no girlfriend depression and absolutely no will to live,0
if you like destiny  but hate getting disappointing every  months then warframe is the fp game for you,1
there is so much to do and grind for that you wont have any time or energy to complain because the time you took to complain about something  primes and  quests came out and now youre  years behind with no relics and no credits and no endo and no build,3
i paid money for games that were much worse,5
so i was just reading the negative reviews of other players with multiple thousands of gameplay hours and thought those hypocrites need balancing out,6
the only difference is that now there is even more of it and they just got bored of the game after spending  quality hours,-1
can you really blame the game for that,0
everyone gets bored of everything eventually there is no escape from the reality,0
super chaos,0
this game is the definition of adhd,12
at first its fun but nothing is clear then everything is clear but no longer fun,0
i sit im depressed i play,0
i have never read so many wiki pages in my life,4
bum bum,0
yeah not because im lazy and irresponsible with money,5
lots of the mission types are skill based in any case so no amount of platinum in game currency will buy you success,25
however this game has a terrible sense of guidance for new players so its recommended you look up guides to see what you must do to progress,4
product received for free  eh its ok gets a bit repetitive after some hours and content recently either takes too damn long to be pushed out or does not really meet players expectations,23
for the new players the ui can be really confusing and some market stuff might make you falsely believe that you need to dump real money to get things like warframes and guns in the game which couldnt be further from the truth,-1
wouldnt waste my time with it otherwise,-1
and a little advice dont blow that platinum as a new player on weapons and warframes its a ripoff because you can easily craft it yourself,25
and dont immediately blow it on cosmetics either,-1
fun and addicting game but stay faaaaar away from the chat features and jobless freaks who moderate it,-1
this game taught me more about farming than farming simulator,11
its sad to say it but warframe has seen me through the hardships of a failed  year relationship after i ended up having sever depression and daily mental breakdowns my partner ended up taking the kids and leaving me,1
the newer updates are dreadful in my eyes and i feel like the game has lost its touch so the warframe i knew and enjoyed i will be forever thankful for and the friends i made during this time playing and having fun together,1
but i will never go back fully to it,-1
but the possibilities made me fear the effort i would need to reach the stars,0
and after a while in which i tried to reach perfection as a tenno i abandoned warframe again,1
i know my enemies and more will be after my soul,-1
a free to play game  and giving it a negative review for insert squealing child rant here  id say you got your moneys worth,23
no game will hold your attention forever nor should it,0
why whine like a child and deprive someone else the chance to have the same fun you obviously did,-1
love the fact that i have  hrs on this game and i got banned and cant play anymore because i am from iran like good job guys,-1
you play warframe cus of the grind  i play warframe cus of the women frames  we are not the same,1
lots and lots of ass,0
doesnt get enough credit or attention,5
nobody will read my review so i will eat  tablespoon of ketchup for every like this gets,-1
my soul has been devoured by this game,-1
months later   soul devoured,-1
platinum is a mean to fashion the hell out of your frames and buy slot and orbiter decorations,25
and last but not least ordis that is indeed a crappy pun,-1
quick reminder  it is grindy as hell what the hell do you expect from a freeplay game,3
and then my girlfriend went to this very friend and now im alone again,0
pretty sure ive committed war crimes in the name of fashion on more than one occasion,-1
this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube,-1
product received for free  i hate this game,23
i dont think i need to say any more here,0
the enemies in the game are  real factions grineer cloned soldiers clad in armor using ballistic weapons,-1
corpus high tech robots and merchants who worship money as their religion,-1
theres very few cosmetics that cant be earned this way and the only reason for that is because they werent designed by the warframe team and were made by creative players the money spent on them turns into a bit of cash in the wallet of the players who created it,1
for a game that was truly terrible and boring when it first came out its impressive beyond anything else,-1
this is a game that truly puts almost every triple a game to shame most other indie games and every other free to play game,9
itll be a bit of a long read,-1
to me the notable flaws are some pretty harsh bugs pphosted multiplayer and a steep obscure learning curve,2
i may as well add the developers propensity for creating content islands to the flaws even though its not done in such a way i personally feel is a turnoff,2
combat in warframe makes you feel like a true murder machine but not in a marysue cookieclicker kind of way,1
the movement is one big part of it with a lot of enemy types with different weapons units that can afflict debuffs on you if youre not careful etc,8
at higher levels those debuffs can easily spell your immediate demise,8
speaking of mods however going onto what i think is one of the most conflictinducing points about this game you can bring up rng,11
and i would disagree,-1
if you play this game in a strictly completionist way you will burn out like a candle in a crematorium,-1
thats not the path the game tries to lead you down though and not the intent of the developers,2
i wont say much more about it,-1
its no surprise some things either take a long time to process or are just lost by the wayside when the community is this active,2
the game breaks in a variety of ways and updates often brings new bugs onto the table,2
most of them are annoying at worst but there are some that can screw you over royally,2
the ones that hurt the most are the ones that renders the client unable to update your account after a mission,7
then when you finish up the mission the game doesnt update your account and you lose the stuff you got in the mission,7
it bites hard,0
loot not dropping isnt nearly as bad as getting the loot and the game just not giving it to you,-1
the worst bugs happen due to poor connectivity between client and host in most cases,2
the game also does a poor job explaining some pretty important things,-1
some things are stowed away in menus people just miss some are briefly mentioned in a tip in a corner of a loading screen some things are just left out totally,-1
the game clearly wants you to find stuff out on your own but for a lot of players it proves an insurmountable task,-1
this isnt necessarily a downside for everyone just that for a lot of players it really feels like youre thrown into the deep end of the pool,4
if youre not into exploring and just want the game to tell you what to do it can be rough,-1
the devs have on occasion tried implement ways to fix it but the problem remains,2
again seems to me its not something the devs forgotten but just havent figured out,2
it really doesnt constitute a problem that hinders the game flow much beyond sometimes feeling kind of stranded in particular content,2
monkey man players seething and malding at the fact they cant afk the game anymore,-1
played it so much i burned out and moved onto other games,0
digital extremes really stuck to their guns and put everything into wf and didnt stop,-1
i cringed at that thought until the story pulled it self into warframe and wow,1
my biggest complaint with the game is why,-1
why do we get all this stuff,0
literally  people play pvp which is a shame,26
why do i need to keep doing what i was doing when its way easier now,0
warframe has a lot of stuff to do but there is no goal,1
i dont know maybe im missing the point,0
with a constant stream of content intimate developer and community relations and a player driven economy based on a tradable and therefore entirely unnecessary to purchase premium currency as far as free to play games go it really doesnt get better than warframe,1
its fast and its grindy,3
it doesnt really sound great spelled out like that but it really is,-1
though it usually feels like my time isnt being respected most of the time with the absurd drop rates and rngesus hating me its still fun if you have the right friends to play this with,-1
u wont find free to play game like this anywhere,9
i hate grinding as much as the next guy but theres just something soothing about it in this game,3
this game is almost nearly impossible to rage in,-1
i dont think i can name any games that are similar to warframe,1
i wont talk about the story much here because it does have a ton of spoilers that i dont want to ruin for new players,14
run sliding is so addicting that you will be trying to do it in every other game you play and then get upset with the fact that you cant,8
i hate this game,0
this game was a very on and off for me but with nothing to do this game is filling that void,0
this game really took the flag and ran with it,0
waste your beginners platinum on a syandana,25
run out of ammo,8
it dies after a few weeks,0
quit warframe,1
kubrow is stuck in the wall,-1
burn your graphics card and cpu,-1
never leave warframe again,1
this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube,-1
farm it up ninjas,10
i need crosssave  plz de plz i cri,-1
pvp isnt that good so if youre looking for that go away but if youre looking for an awesome coop expierence picking up loot building weapons and warframes then get this game,26
the cons are the game can bug out at times,-1
some players may just stand around doing nothing or be bad at the game,4
before i played this i had a small penis no girlfriend and no will to live,0
this game is like cocaine but worse since you can at least run out of cocaine,12
something that you never realize you want it,-1
now have ptsd whenever i think about installing this,-1
dont play this game solo,0
the only game you can sink hundreds of hours into and still have no idea what youre supposed to do,0
just about every looter shooter ive tried over the years has fallen short of anything longlasting for me,-1
this is a slow burn game,-1
you dont need to spend a penny on this game,5
very much grind lost gf bcs of the grind,3
look at them they come to this review when they know they are not pure,16
players use the keys but they are mere trespassers,15
we cannot blame these creatures they are being led by a false prophet an impostor who knows not the secrets of the valve,13
behold the players come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm,19
i will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my steam key,15
the players are lost and they will resist,20
but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
dont play this game,0
its quite daunting to get into with just how much content is present,-1
i hate this game,0
you are awoken rudely by the vile grineer captain vor who has discovered a tenno a space ninja on the wild planet earth,10
you think back on how all this led to her passing and how you took the loss by losing yourself in dark souls,21
trying to break free from the indirect siren song of her voice and orders over your warframe you are powerless,1
this detour of the galaxy taking a dark turn you dont want to face your fellow tenno old friends from a forgotten time now under the control of the lotus,0
the risks of the nebula be damned,0
ive had crack less addicting than this,12
tldr if you generally dislike grinding this isnt the game for you,3
the general player this is where the majority of both new and old players either get loads burnouts or just straight up quit the game,4
youre probably thinking how the hell can endless hours of constant grinding be fun or something along those lines,3
even the worst kinds of weapons can be surprisngly effective or do the most hilarious things you would not see in any other game,8
too much content for a free game,9
very addictive lots of grinding so many things to do that in the beginning it can be overwhelming,-1
dont know if i like it yet,0
how is this game free and division costs  bucks,9
ahhh my head hurts,0
wanna blitz around spreading misery as quickly as possible got you covered,0
it can be buggy it can be hard to follow at some points and some of the timers are clearly a relic of the past that refuses to let go but for every one of these complaints you can find something good,2
a game where you can become hilariously overpowered space ninjas that blow up millions of enemies everyday just to get that stupid mod that just wont drop,10
not addictive but not as bad as i thought it would be,12
product received for free  most of the time i log into this game and completely black out coming to only when ive clicked the shutdown button,23
its something about space ninjas and men in walls i wouldnt know i wasnt conscious for any of it,10
you say only to go back to your orbiter and learn that it takes  hours to build the weapon is trash tier without prime mods and the only thing youll ever need to use is spinwin atterax welcome to warframe,1
the solar system is in chaos and its up to you to maintain the balance,0
you end the game as a walking warcrime with a saitama complex,1
i have absolutely no idea what im doing,0
before i played warframe i had a small wee wee no friends no boyfriend and absolutely no will to live,1
my girlfriend hates this game,0
its also farmville but a shooter,11
the game gets boring after you become a highrank scrublord,0
theres so much grinding you would think that youre a puerto rican hooker,3
i broke up with my girlfriend because of this game,0
very hard to get people into the game,4
very little tutorials or explanations at the start and wait times for mr weapons is a bit silly,4
early game is pretty boring and bad,0
if anything needs to get updated or fixed its that,2
shut up ordis,-1
mysterious storyline but it doesnt matter,14
honestly everytime i play this game im just lost,0
beware new players this game has a lot to learn and it doesnt teach you by holding your hand,-1
the game doesnt block you or turn into a snoozefest just because you dont want to pony up the dough,0
play warframe if   you have no life  you want a good mmorpg game  youre bored enough to read my review  actually have a pc,1
grinded for  years straight   still not max serration   fml,3
game is currently being review bombed by mostly people who are butt hurt about the aoe meta and wukong being nerfed and to those people all i have to say is a phrase you used against the rest of us for so long now                   git gud,6
ignore me,0
i just hate the write a review window,6
im just balancing out the reviews complaining that they have to actually conserve ammo and not use wukong to afk farm,6
at first i didnt like it the grind sometimes is hard especially at the beginning,3
look at them they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16
tenno use the keys but they are mere trespassers,15
i was cut in half destroyed but through its janus key the void called to me,21
we cannot blame these creatures they are being led by a false prophet an impostor who knows not the secrets of the void,13
behold the tenno come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm,19
forever bound to the void,18
the tenno are lost and they will resist,20
but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
warframe isnt anything special,1
not even a little bit,0
hours playing warframe  dude this game sucks grinding nonstop useless weapons and my warframe seems to be made of paper   hours playing warframe     a lone liset vessel travelled through the atmosphere of pluto,1
pretty confusing early on,-1
the most negative aspects of warframe in its current state is probably the interface and places where you find the things you might need,1
especially as a new player its easy to get lost with all the different menus and there is way more complexity than necessary making it feel unstructured at times,4
a definite plus for everyone who is tired of brain damaged idiots who rage about lack of skills while playing in game sessions tagged for beginners quite common in certain mobas,4
the new player experience is terrible though so get used to reading the wiki and viewing tutorials,4
i still have yet to kill or capture an eidolon and have no clue about anything regarding the orb mothers,-1
i am so confused,0
a dont trust anyone in the trade chat game xd,-1
warframe was there when my dog died,1
warframe was there when i lost my job,1
warframe was there when i was depressed,1
warframe was also the cause of the terrible things that happened in my life                but that lato vandal and excalibur proto armor skin was worth it,1
i am sorry for deceiving you,0
yes the game can be grindy  but please tell me a single game that doesnt have some sort of grind system or does everyone want to have everything within a week,3
if you cant be bothered to read me yapping i dont blame you then tldr warframe is a timeconsuming but rewarding game,1
this game uses a cash shop although using it is easy its not always the best thing to doas you still have to play,-1
my only gripe is a few thingsthe tutorial and help stuff isnt very goodat times i didnt see what i was supposed to do next and didnt see the small text explaining my powers or how i could open certain lockers etc,4
also many missions seam to just all together give up on stealththere you are sneaking around taking your timeand suddenly everything comes after you,7
i tend to do things slowlyi like to ninja the missions in gameskill them all so to speak at timesbut this game sometimes forces me to run out,7
fissure missions bounty missions and infested missions all have this global they come right at you thingno matter where you areits very annoying,7
this in turn makes me miss items and hidden stuffwhich is annoying and disapointing,-1
i first played it years ago when it came out both on pc and ps but for some reasons i couldnt get much into it,0
its absolutely massive and to be honest it can be overwhelming for new players,4
only thing i dislike about this game is that digital extremes sold out to the chinese group leyou and now its been bought back by tencent,2
and that is not good at all for the future in my opinion,0
steam players helped to make this game a success and now we are at the mercy of epictencent anti consumers policies,-1
pretty sad if you ask me,0
theres no one around and your comms is dead,0
hes almost upon you now and you can see theres blood on his face,22
my god theres blood everywhere,0
hes brandishing a scythe its stalker,22
lurking in the shadows murderer killer stalker,22
killing for revenge stalker,22
laughing at the bodies sadistic murderer stalker,22
now the lockdown is raised and you seem to have lost him but youre hopelessly lost yourself,0
stranded with a murderer you creep silently through the ships halls,22
now your screen is black youre probably dead from stalker,22
but he doesnt see you fumbling stalker,22
backstabbing stalker,22
fighting for your life with stalker wrestling a scythe from stalker stab it in his neurodes safe at last from stalker,22
you limp towards extraction still stuttering from bad performance issues,-1
theres an arrow to your head and death in his eyes but you farmed for that fists stance body slam murderer stalker legendary fight with stalker normal tuesday night for stalker you try to swing a scythe at stalker but now your friend is trying to skype you,22
hes dodging every swipe he parries to the left you counter to the right you catch him in the neck youre chopping off his head now you have just decapitated stalker,22
fair warning tho this game is a huge time sink and will eventually give you a god complex to the point youll start itching if you dont manage to kill everything on the map within  seconds,0
theres also the super heavy rng based farming which can also be very annoying at times,11
about the devs im fairly sure their attitudes reflect the hate they receive daily,2
they can sometimes do kneejerk reactions which always open the floodgate,2
now events arent as great as they used to be,-1
they have done some unfortunate things but nobodys perfect,-1
the game definitely has its issues but they are being worked on,2
they need to make it slightly annoying to get stuff for free so there will be a reason to spend money,-1
i cant not recommend this game any longer,0
i cant believe this is free is the right expression,9
i regret i didnt play it sooner,0
my friend that didnt like the game actually sticks to warframe for sometime,1
hours later all of my friends gave up  and im still playing this masterpiece,0
this game is not paywin,24
i have no idea what i am doing,0
warframe does not in fact allow paying customers to gain such power,1
while the loot drops and slight grindiness can be a turn off it is often offset by just how the gameplay feels fluid and intuitive to get into,-1
i spent  hours in the past two weeks playing this and i regret none of it,0
i cant believe its been  years already,-1
dont get yourself chat suspended,-1
this game sucks so bad,0
blizzard and ea can dream of money if they continue to make such crappy games take an example from warframe,1
their goal is to one day find a cure for their species which rapidly degrade due to the cloning process,-1
the corpus their rival faction is all about tech and greed,-1
always send robots to do their jobs,-1
dominating the market even joining all sides of a war to make trade while at war with them is their buisness,-1
the orokin the infested and the sentientswell theyre secretive bizzare and supposedly long gone,-1
while the game cant be considered pay  win due to the extreme focus on coop gameplay its diminished a little due to the existance of the conclave the pvp enviorment,24
its community is the complete opposite of warframes normal side,1
its incredibly toxic even in the team based pvp,26
the normal parts of the game can get really chaotic,-1
from hoarding every piece of equipment right down to scanning everything in a massive lorehunt,1
players are technically overpowered and will pretty much always be this way,-1
youre a metal ninja with stuff straight out of magic defying the laws of gravity even create limbo in a area,10
later levels and planets in the game can get absolutely insane with the number of mobs from the many factions,7
nothing ever feels as good as firing two rounds of a shotgun with radiated fire bullets and have its ultimate skill send off a aoe that melts away armor and just makes everything explode,8
theres a problem with the loot though that can push people away,-1
on top of this you need to farm for materials to craft them to begin with,11
platnium can come in to speed up the process so it has the feeling of the typical bad facebook game,-1
i cant play fallout  i can just barely play injustice but i can easilly run this game on around medium settings,-1
rng can bless you or hate you as you try to grind for the same item for weeks,-1
are you a donkey,0
do you want to do things over and over and over again without any purpose,0
i want to have sex with the infested,-1
fun but it gets extremely repetitive and theres diminishing content the later you go,0
youre not losing any money over it unless you choose to,5
come on dude take a shower please,0
similar in some ways to the multiplayer experience seen in mass effect  warframe wastes no time in telling stories particularly elaborate,1
the background narrative in fact will give us an excuse to put ourselves in the shoes of ninja called to fight a futuristic alien faction,10
the objectives vary enough but the main flaw of the title digital extremes is out soon given the limited variety of levels,-1
the gameplay fortunately fairly obvious problems of repetition of the title,-1
waste your beginners platinum on a syandana,25
run out of ammo,8
it dies after a few weeks,0
quit warframe,1
kubrow is stuck in the wall,-1
burn your graphics card and cpu,-1
never leave warframe again,1
dont mind me just countering the review bomb from braindead pissbabies malding that they cant literally afk the game anymore,6
i broke up with my gf once because of this game it consumes life itself,0
product received for free  farmframe i spent all my time on this bad boy,23
i hate this game,0
meh get boring after a while,0
a very complex mmo with a freaking huge world freaking many guns and items and freakin many enemies,-1
but u will spend horrific much time in that game,0
this game is a digital heroin addiction,12
i havent been outside my house is  days this game is destroying my life,0
whatever you do dont play this game,0
not sure i can say anything about this game that hasnt already been said tbh,0
two tips for getting started though  dont be afraid to ask seemingly stupid questions,4
im shocked to say the least that this game is well optimized for a freetoplay game,9
like im not even joking those robots are mind blowing even by human standards,-1
you ready to waste hours of your life,0
nobody will read my review so i will eat  chili pepper without milk for every like this gets,-1
few days later he left me then i didnt know what to do and soon i discover that playing solo is hard,0
the grineer used to be builders now all they make is war,-1
the game offers very little guidance for new players and often have to use youtube to guide them,4
this process is fun but also tiresome especially without friends,-1
cons steep learning curve game doesnt offer much guidance can be time consuming sometimes feels too tedious,-1
we really need some serious college courses for this game,4
its just a game i dont like to study about everything in this game,0
shame about the wife and children though maybe ill get to see them on weekends,0
warframes story made me cry,1
giving a review only to counteract the negative reviews from the raging babies who are bad at video games,6
oh no,0
they cant constantly wipe the whole map with a single click of the mouse anymore,-1
in a game thats all about murdering things in style,-1
how dare they,-1
what a difficult game,-1
clicking left mouse button is really hard,7
what a sad state of affairs,0
sadly the story is a lot of times confusing i cannot really understand most of the time what is happening storywise and its also quite forgetful also the achievements on this game are on another level,14
one requires you to revive  allies one to drive with the kdrive mil meters and the master rank ones are just a nightmare,1
i hate grinding,3
everyone is aware how grindy the game is and we dont care because it plays so so very well,3
please dont be swayed by the negative reviews posted by other people they are just unhappy with the aoe and wukong nerfs wherein most of them are not even playing the game properly lol,6
aoe meta is dumb anyway,6
my dog ate a pipe bomb after i got volt prime,8
the storyline is fairly basic but servicable,14
you have access to a wide variety of weapons ranging from high tech railguns to a whip made from the spine of a feral beast coated in lethal parasitic growths,8
you shoot the same man over and over again to level up your stuff so that you can shoot that same man faster sending his family into terrible debt paying for multiple funerals just as the daily grind of life leaves families in deeper and deeper debt,-1
with no way out you keep shooting that poor man hoping that eventually there will be something beyond shooting the same dude you dont care about him or what grief comes of your action you just want to shove a potato up your butt,-1
you can even shove a potato up their butt,-1
the social aspect of the game is weak actually very similar to borderlands,-1
people just form parties and get on with it without moaning that player isnt performing or whatever,4
teamplay tends to be very poor but thats actually very typical for a coop,-1
the average young lad is more interested in ramboing a level rather than doing what he should be doing  acting as part of a team so many players are primarily built for dps and speed,4
how strange is that,-1
the main quests in the game are good but the ingame explanations are very poor,14
the only one real criticism i have found is that in two solo quests it locks you in the quest until you have won,14
you cant get out by dying,0
you cant get help from friends,0
to my mind that is utter insanity,0
so many players will have reached one of those points and just thrown in the towel,4
there isnt really much warning either  you could well have a useless warframe on when you reach the point and its really game over,1
seems strange on an mmo that you want to get rid of customers,-1
really total nonsensethank heaven there are only two points like that,-1
ultimately the downfall  the reason you may stop playing the game  is the lack of variation in missions and the lack of true coop play,-1
dont think for an instant that its not worth playing though it most certainly is,-1
shame i didnt know there was one already out there,-1
stop wasting time,0
taking breaks from this game is a pain in the ass because theres a big new thing every month and i have to learn a wholeass new system when i come back to it,0
besides my review dont waste your money on anything besides this,6
however ive spent thousands of hours and dollars on this game and i cannot justify spending any more money,5
game breaking bugs have remained in the game for years,2
with every new update i wonder which new bugs ill have to play around,2
well its also not free and id expect better from any other game or developer,9
for all the crap that the devs can get sometimes they are always adding new content and adjusting old content to help make sure almost nothing is out of the meta,2
when i first started playing warframe i was hesitant to continue because there were so many things to do,1
ive been playing this game for about  years now and its about time for me to move away,0
the bad  hard to get into the game due to the sheer amount of content and things to do,4
long waiting times for new items to finish crafting,-1
game can be buggy sometimes,2
the main bad guy of the game is named small biggie he doesnt believe good kush and alcohol is mlg and wants to destroy it and the people who like it but you have snoop doggs main hoe on your side so its okay,12
will you ever get your good kush and alcohol back,-1
great game but its hard to play it everyday,0
instead of handing out money and lifesaving surgeries to those in need i charitably hand out valueless digital space doohickeys and gizmos to people who beg me to stop,5
warframe suffers from the same issue most live service games suffer and that is that the core gameplay loop is sometimes neglected for an extedned amount of time while more focus is put on shiny new content,1
as a long time player of warframe youll find that there is a lack of a true endgame and updates feel small and meaningless for the most part,1
granted players doing raids arent always very nice as well as people on region chat but other than thatin my experiencethe community is overall very giving and helping especially the veteran players,2
look at them they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16
tenno use the keys but they are mere trespassers,15
i was cut in half destroyed but through its janus key the void called to me,21
we cannot blame these creatures they are being led by a false prophet an impostor who knows not the secrets of the void,13
behold the tenno come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm,19
forever bound to the void,18
the tenno are lost and they will resist,20
but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
at first i thought that it would probably be bad since its free to play and released in  but no i was surprised on how wrong i was,-1
i am still shocked on how much content there is for a free to play game,9
send help  i cant stop playing this game its too good its ruining my marriage i am a dessicated husk of my former self due to improper hydration please send help i cant stop,0
i could have gotten laid in the time i spent playing this,0
id rather play this than sex,0
this game obviously had a lot of work put into it which is why i do not understand why it is free,9
you go to the store to buy a carton of milk but by the time you get it home the milk is already expired and it costs  platinum to put it in your fridge,-1

this game is very good but the grinding is insane and you got to be patient and i hate the fact that you have to wait  days just to build a new warframeits also very confusing when you start playing for the first time like this game has been going on for many years yet they still didnt build a system that is helpful,1
its buggy held together by tape and bubblegum in places the devs often have ideas that go beyond their abilities and thus fall flat when they come out,2
just some people abuse this system and it makes the others look extremely bad,2
some things id say are overpriced like octavias musical tones like jesus christ why are those worth  platinum but overall id say warframe handles its microtransaction system perfectly,1
anyways it is very easy to spend way too much on this game im sure ive spent hundreds on this yes yes i feel the shame,5
its a little confusing at first,-1
dont ever do that just wait it out,0
its a looter shooter and a damn good one at that,-1
space nazis corporate jackasses and space zombies respectively,10
and thats just scratching the surface,17
why am i running these missions,7
its an open game and this works against it at times,2
the worst offender is the lack of documentation on a lot of the game,-1
two issues you might want to be aware of before you play the new player experience is really dull you start with mostly crap gear barely any money or resources and it will take you quite a while to get anywhere in this game without friends especially without friends who have been playing for a long time as they can hook you up with some good mods and some platplatinum the games premium currency to get yourself going,4
the last one at least for me is that this game can cause some serious burnout as this game is very farmy you will spend hours doing the same missions over and over and over again just to get one blueprint or one component or to farm a specific resource and that can wear down on you pretty hard after a while,7
ps i almost forgot in the game at first do not understand what they want from you in a mission where to go and who to shoot but eventually everything falls into place,7
sorry for my english      fp,0
matter of grind grind all the time if you dont like the grind you cant play all the time,3
look at them they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16

but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
i have been thinking about this game way too much,0
it is consuming my thoughts,-1
how the hell is this fp,-1
if you arent hooked by that point this just aint for you,12
i have absolutely no idea what such a hypothetical person would possibly be into but i shudder at the thought,-1
i have spent more than  hours in this game and im still not tired of it,0
that has to say something about the quality of this game right,-1
its entirely pve except for a very small subsection of pvp that is hardly ever played so the game is all about killing hordes upon hordes of enemies and to get loot,26
really the only things missing from this game are dinosaurs pirates and trains,4
the game has many purposes there is too many mission types,7
the game is focused on farm and grind if you do not like this type of games it will not be suitable for you,11
its just like teenage mutant ninja turtles but with guns,10
apparently noobs have to actually play the game now instead of picking wukong and overpowered aoe weapons,6
helping friends get into the game i can really see the kind of monotonous grind that is expected of them and its daunting,3
while i found older content to be very cohesive some parts of the games newer content are very grating to me personally,2
some of the confusion is definitely intended in order to add mystery but other points feel as if introductions were skipped in a shallow attempt to force unfamiliarity,14
oh man,0
there are two main things setting this game back and limiting its full potential   the omission of competitive pvp to cater to the hardcore audience  lack of crosssave functionality  alas theres no clear confirmation whether the devs will eventually make those things happen or not,26
anyone who can argue that this game is not the best freetoplay game of all time has not played this game enough,9
edit after tons of time on here it does get a bit grind intensive,3
some nerfs have made it even more grindy too,3
ive always heard of this game via word of mouth but i never gave it a shot or even looked into it,-1
but cmon whos gonna do that,17
there are various methods of monetization but the only things you cant get without paying up are purely cosmetic,5
one of the biggest criticisms of warframe you used to see was that it was too grindy as most mmos are,1
if you though that black ops iiis parkour was fun which is not imo think again,7
the game does have some flaws though,-1
i couldnt get out of a success screen even though i was pressing b,-1
the game isnt without its flaws though,-1
there are a few bugs that irritate the heck out of me such as mission waypoints bugging out and not displaying properly or the rare moments of falling through the map when deploying my kdrive,2
its just too bad brian is racist,0
lotus say artour potato harvest is bad,-1
sorry for is not have english,0
please no cyka pasta,10
a purple dragon held me hostage and made me play this game,0
look at them they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16

this game will turn any boob man into a ass man  edit  it took me from start to finish about  hours to get the frame i was referring to wisp,-1
review bombing a game over country settings is the dumbest thing ive ever heard,6
the negative things some bugs and pvp is in a bad way in my opinion,26
why are these fools still breathing my air,13
update still kicks ass,2
constantly being updated for many years for free only thing costing money being decoration and cosmetics and most those decorations and cosmetics you can get from trading up,-1
there is increasingly more content that cannot be done solo and that makes me somewhat sad but de will never particularly leave you in the dust as a solo player,-1
in the end everyone can melt a map but not everyone looks good doing it,-1
saying that it takes a long while to level to get money and to be able to buy anything,-1
if you dont want to grind then this game probably isnt for you,3
there is no actual advantage to be gained by paying money except for saving yourself a bit of time and grind,5
i believe literally the only thing that only real money can buy is some cosmetics and more storage space if youre the sort of pack ratlike me who wont even throw away a bad or mediocre piece of equipment because what if and also because it would leave unsatisfactory holes in the collection,5
buffs and reworks to stuff that doesnt work or has ended up being underpowered constant introductions of new frames new gear new quests new areas etc,1
the only complaints i could make about parts that require a bit too much grinding is levelling up the quills and vox solaris but even thats been largely dealt with by subsequent updates if you dont mind doing a bit of research to see what the most effective approach is,3
addictive lootershooter,-1
anyone calling this pw doesnt know what that means,-1
this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube,-1
also the games biggest downfall since if youre a new player or an experienced player coming back all of the new content gives you an aneurysm when trying to digest it,4
without the warframe wiki and youtube i would have crywanked myself to sleep many times,1
we all agreed while its great for a free to play game containing some beautiful graphical work some interesting game mechanics and good controller support it gets tedious very quickly and nothing really makes it stand apart from a failed thirdperson action game like too human unfortunately,-1
its also quite a tough game to get a grip of as it contains lack of explaination about how certain aspects of upgrading and customising a character work,-1
unfortunately it is not a massive multiplayer you can play it only alone or coop in the open world while the missions are pretty much instanced,-1
it is funny that some players that spent thousands of hours in the game criticize it,6
but that is just my personal opinion so please dont count it as valid,-1
ive been mia lately because of this game,0
i have no social life,0
i basically lost all little contact ive had,0
ive been so tired that i thought i saw a grineer walk pass me,-1
like but not the best online action game,-1
do not play this game unless you enjoy grinding,3
i wake up screaming at night because i have nightmares about things not dropping,-1
this game doesnt cut content it expands on it,-1
no other fp title on steam really comes close to this,-1
the biggest critisisms i could offer are that this game could use more and bigger boss battles,-1
hated borderlands hated destiny hated all mmorpgs  i love warframe,1
it sadly also has some downsides like expencive dlcs,-1
it feels like doing the same thing every mission,7
i can never stick to the same warframe because each one has their uses in different situations,1
the mod system is a bit tricky at first and very overwhelming but a few hours researching and consulting chat will clear that up,4
i will note that its best to play with friends to really get into the game as it can get very boring and lonely by yourself,4
god help me,0
other than that its a very grindy game,3
this game is just minecraft with guns,-1
if had to say one thing in the negative about it it would be the real world dollar cost on any of their items,5
what have you got to lose,0
afk simulator k,11
youll be parkouring over obstacles climbing on walls hacking apart enemies and sliding across floors while going all john woo on anyone that stands between your teams and your objective ninja,8
if you think this game looks old by todays standards well you are wrong,-1
but the playable content has become so huge that youll probably never feel the farming as tedious,11
be warned though you will loose many hours of your life in this game  wiggle wiggle wiggle,0
at first i really didnt like this game,0
i played it back in january of  for a couple hours and felt utterly lost and confused on what was going on,-1
again i was confused lost and irritated along with my clansmen,0
ever wanted to commit legal genocide in unspeakable and unhumane ways,-1
however theres many more ways to commit beuatiful war crimes all you have to do is press download wait the for the game to download and pray your device is good enough to see all the pretty colours from all the particles,-1
huh only downside,-1
where has this game been all my life,0
a very complex mmo with a freaking huge world freaking many guns and items and freakin many enemies,1
but u will spend horrific much time in that game,0
xd not big on variety and like i mentioned zero story but its free so,9
fun game but the downside is that you have to put in a lot of hours and the repetitiveness of the levels would eventually dull ones senses,-1
defeats the purpose of getting abilities and items in the first place,-1
ignore the negative reviews,6
those are left by kids who were sad their autoplay button was taken away,-1
if a couple kids were to go away and leave the game making the community a lot healthier then i say good riddance,-1
it has been  years of ups and downs,-1
if only totalbiscuit could have seen all this,-1
never preorder lads,0
back when all of us tried it in beta this game was only ok it did get repetitive and eventually i quit,2
essentially dont nerf a frame you just released into oblivion and then tell me that your listening to my feedback while you delete comments,1
dont lie to me that its going to be a minor change and then kill him,0
dont ruin endgame things by making cc even more irrelavant,-1
warfreaky,1
i have no shame,-1
then what the hell ya waiting for go for it,0
no one can stay away from these bloody battles,-1
the so called warriors who have spent a century in a temporary state of suspended animation since the completion of the old civil war,-1
the infected group includes robots or humans affected by a certain technocytic plague,-1
none of them are like the other,0
here is a list of a few cons that could be improved after the post of this review to list the pros would be too long    early game struggle from me going back to the beginning by creating a seperate account  no directions for people who dont know how to look if someone doesnt know where to look for info on the game they might dislike it out of misunderstanding  overall this game isnt for everyone but in my opinion its a fantastic game,6
its pretty grindy and time consuming so i cant recommend the game to everyone,3
when everything in my life went down someone gave me his account and said go there and find some friends,0
the people i gathered for a clan in a game cried for me,0
these people are another family for me,0
one thing i found a bit disturbing is the fact that level isnt much taken in account,-1
warframe is a game deeply cheated by its metacritic scores the unfair perception that you have to pay to win ive plzuddamy fp mmos and warframe is the absolute least unfair in pricing practices as well as the vastly inferior destiny series,1
apart from being playable on pc what warframe brings over destiny is a truly well thought through lore and plot but more importantly it doesnt have an open world,1
the only and big problem is that the game is extremely boring,-1
the missions are extremely repetitive theres no history plot to follow or anything,7
after crafting and leveling weapons and suits again and again for no apparent reason you start to wonder if its worth the time expended in this,-1
since i dont enjoy pvp in general for the same reason that the game becomes boring after some time why i should do it,26
i cant give a thumbs up for a game that i install and uninstall from time to time,-1
update  after the firing squad whining about the only  hours i had at the time i wrote my first review and the promises of the world changing second dream and war within quests i can surely say that its pretty much all the same,1
ive done almost all the quests and one doesnt link to anotherits just small tales on the same old maps,14
new characters appearing just in those quests that simply doesnt mean anything to the player new answers for questions never made and new ways of thinking to problems that you never had,14
the game is repetitive and boring,0
its up to the player to take a liking of something that each one needs to find on our own because the game only provides half information  and this is way worse than having none,4
product received for free  if i hadnt been playing since launch and someone told me this game is almost  years old id call them a liar,23
gosh damn my pinky finger hurts,0
i dont have a girlfriend now i dont need it anymore,0
i havent fapped for  days because of this game it has ruined my life,0
game for people with no life,0
i started playing warframe when chroma came out and it got bored really quick i dont know why maybe it wasnt the right time for me to play it or the fact that i chose volt as my main frame,1
there are some minor issues such as the customer service in occasions and how repetative the missions can get,7
game is still great as of veilbreaker people are just reviewbombing because their afk farms no longer work and they cant level accounts to illegally sell on anymore,-1
what do i like about this weird game,0
it might be a bit difficult to understand the game mechanics at first since it has a lot to offer with not enough explaining to the player how things work making it kinda confusing,4
look at them they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16
tenno use the keys but they are mere trespassers,15
i was cut in half destroyed but through its janus key the void called to me,21
we cannot blame these creatures they are being led by a false prophet an impostor who knows not the secrets of the void,13
behold the tenno come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm,19
forever bound to the void,18
the tenno are lost and they will resist,20
but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
hunter your reliance on that ability is skewing my data,-1
hunter i have temporarily disabled that ability,-1
this experiment will fail if your efficiency drops further,-1
its free  its grindy  its repetitive  its expensiveit will make you broke on several things ingame  and it will take half of your lifetime,-1
its extremely repetitious but that hasnt stopped me from playing it,0
after  hours i am very suprised this game is not talked about more by the gaming jurnalism,-1
this game either wants to be a slaughterbox simulator or a fishing simulator,11
warframe warframe you strange beast youre repetitive and obnoxious but damn i love you,1
when i came back i returned to a fourway galatic war between a dogmatic corporate religion a militarist legion of recursive clones transhuman assassins struggling to retain their humanity and an infestation so virulent that it makes the former three point their guns at it in unity,10
there needs to be some frickin books made about this game,4
downside is crafting takes forever so upgrading your warframe and weapons will be a bit of a grind,1
now i just log on and stare at embers ass,0
make no mistake warframe definitely has its flaws,1
its got more bugs than a nyc apartment its poorly thought out in some places some of the frames have basically been forgotten and have been untouched for months or years the grind is brutal to get certain things,2
just boot up an endless mission turn your brain off and enjoy the carnage,7
when this game first came out it seemed repetative and the more and more updates come out it gets less and less repetative,2
downside to this game are its costs to buy platinum real world currency to in game currency,25
this is war,-1
addicted help me,12
community is a bit hard on the devs though,2
how can i put this into words,-1
if you took the multiplayer coop from mass effect  then gave them three extra years to produce and tune it into a fullfledged multiplayer experience then you take that game and force feed it piles of amphetamine and hallucenogenic substances,-1
the resulting spawn from this unholy union of games is warframe,1
new players are going to be at a severe disadvantage if theyre unwilling to drop a bit of cash on it,4
let me put it this way ive put a lot more money into much less deserving titles with much less value to show for it,5
most actionpacked farming simulator ive ever played,11
the shooting is not bad nor decent,0
the maps are too large ans shameish and all are the same metalwall corridors with too rare exceptions,7
and its safe to say that i have an unhealthy addiction to this game,12
update after taking a break from warframe upon coming back i think my initial review was a bit too harsh,1
previous review the devs have abandoned what made this game fun in favor of cranking out new ways to monetize this increasingly bloated and tedious game,2
it started with ld then after ld it was mother then after mother it was vala seriously stop with the hot women i cant play the game when horny,0
and you do it by jumping around and instantly merking poor losers in the face with weird guns and powers,8
although fun i find that it takes an incredible amound of time before you actually understand what tf is actually happening,1
it shouldnt even be free,9
that being said if you dont enjoy a good grind or have patience for building new stuff then it may not be for you,3
ive spent some money but not much and the game never really asks for more,5
they can be ungodly stubborn on the weirdest of issues and there are problems aplenty concerning how the developers think things should be vs how players actually interact with the game,2
i could point to other examples of antagonism between developers and players such as oberons rework behavior on devstreams being condescending if not outright mocking having a community that needs to scream as a collective voice to get compromise measures and more,2
however all of these pale in comparison to threatening a minor with legal action rather than attempting to work with this obviously very enthusiastic person to help in not just spreading information across the community and acting as independant verification of released info but also help track down those that have hacked unreleased items into the game excaliber umbra prime and primed streamline,2
instead they do not go after the actual hackers and go after the prominant largely benign dataminer who has repetedly expressed a willingness to work with digital extremes,-1
i cannot condone this behavior nor will i advise anyone give them business until this matter has resolved as a show of support,2
boring after a while,0
i have barely begun my journey into this game and i havent even scratched the top of the iceberg,-1
years later i cannot say that i regret purchasing one of the original founder packs,-1
the amount of grinding in this game is equal to the amount of grinding i want to do on female frames asses,3
theres no way ivara is a stealth frame with that dumptruck clapping every steps,-1
grinding has never been so time consuming,3
i hope your a social butterfly because your not going to go kirito on this game and beat it solo not that you can beat mmos,-1
its a terribly repetitive game with more farming going on then in alabama,11
there are tons of things you can throw your money at but your paying because your lazy and you want the items now,5
its pay because your a bunch lazy laurens not pay to win,24
curse these hormones,0
i found this game is kinda hard to start because of the large amout of things you need to know as a beginner,4
the bad    becomes repetitieve quickly such that the grind for the prime warframes will probably extend beyond your forebearance for repeating the same content over and over,1
this can become annoying if you want to collect resources or just play at a more relaxed pace and you may find yourself soloing often,-1
many of the menus and game systems are counterintuitive and could be designed to be more user friendly,-1
though i prefer it to be played on playstation  this game never fails to disappoint me in any way,0
i didnt want another grindy mmo to take up my time,-1
to warframes to ships to homes to clan worlds to settings not a fan of blood and gore,1
out of  hours and a year of playing i ran into one rude person,0
being fast overpowered and having crazy effects,-1
well this game is very exhausting but maybe it is just me,0
the ranking up system can be troublesome but still the game is in the creation process,4
if you dislike pwin games then you might like thist one,0
the only things you have to pay for is your own lazyness your looks and convenience,5
like it dont like it its a fact,0
if you dont then the game is most likely not for you,0
then theres people downvoting the game after  hours because theres nothing left to do,0
running and developping such a game takes a lot of money,5
that sounds like a mobile game cashgrab i agree,-1
mindless bashing wont get you to endgame not if you dont know what youre doing,-1
the game doesnt hold your hand,-1
but why buy something when you can painfully farm it for hours,11
you can get by without spending any cash but it is not as enjoyable,5
its a good game but as you reach the end youll see how pointless some of the things you do really are,0
highly recommended if your into space and beating up people,10
i had thought of this game as paytowin at one point when i was first starting out and thats because i never put in the time to gather the resources and make my own stuff like i do now,5
this game could use a few tweaks but you cant blame the thing considering its only in open beta for the moment and trust me alpha was much worse if youre having problems adapting to open beta,2
i cant stop please send platinum help,0
when all others in your play list have gotten boring and you are thinking of going out and buying another click warframe and let the money stay in your wallet,1
when a free to play game is done so painstakingly well it is hard to encourage someone to go purchase a game,9
the only defect its that the scenario tends to be repetitive in long times,2
sorry for my bad english,0
farmed for months to get a weapon that went obsolete in a week,-1
i cant im low mastery should use market to access some medium weapons i get blueprint now what,1
updating my review since a lot has changed since i last threw one out there  warframe is not a game for everyone,1
its grindy its aesthetic can sometimes be a bit unnerving without context and at times it can feel slow,3
after years of patching and balancing theres very few warframes the characters you play as that define your power set and weapons that arent at least a bit viable and almost all of them are distinct in their playstyle and role,1
but i have to reiterate  this game is not for everyone,0
if its not your cup of tea if the grind puts a bit too much weight on you if you struggle to find stuff to do in a vacuumat least give it a shot but dont feel bad for putting it down,3
its going to eat consume your life,-1
i would care about the bugs if i had paid anything but well you cant ask for much more,-1
expensive hobby is full of overpriced content,-1
which is why i quit after  hours of game,0
contradict me before you play these games,0
shooting dismembering throwing evaporizing melting to name a few,-1
these are one but many things you can do to your unlucky enemies in warframe,-1
sure the game has its flaws the main one being the netcode of the game using twice as much pc resources when you host but with the newest patches it has been alleviated by a lot,2
if you get forced into it by friends it will probably not be for you because you just gotta vibe,4
the free to play economy makes the game inherently grindy on some aspects as to give players incentives to go and buy a few things for convenience sake on that note i wouldnt recommand buying premium currency directly as you can get some pretty heavy discounts as daily login rewards,5
screw your review bombing,6
warframe is that drug that you take once to be social and then it ruins your life,1
who doesnt like minecraft,-1
cons the game is a grindy game,3
although a big update is coming plains of eidolon that promises new end game content the game doesnt offer the most sensational experience when you have your ultimate loadout completed,2
there are a few bugs mostly items falling through the earth or mission items not appearing in inventory but they are extremely rare,2
so many ways to play this game it is pretty much for everyone except for those who dont have patience or the willpower for the grind,3
do not play if you have a life,0
the game itself has a very steep learning curve,-1
very few games in the industry have such freedom for their players for the fear of the freedom being exploited,9
if youre not a fan of shooter games you can use a melee weapon as a main weapon and turn to a hack n slash playstyle,-1
their quests and lore are enough to reduce their playerbase to tears with unseen plottwists and character progression,14
still playing the crap out of this game do it,0
what looks like a generic rdperson fp shooter has buckets of content behind it,-1
maybe none of that matters to you,0
its a time consuming game,0
from an ancient slumber you awaken a slumber that would only be undone by a threat wich plagues the planets and solar systems,-1
from poison darts to a fully automatic assault rifle,8
whereas deathcube will vaporize enemies,8
the enemies   grineer  corpus  infested  the grineer  the grineer are an advanced race using weapons like assault rifles machine guns cleavers and anything that would use normal bullets or slash through flesh,-1
the infested  the infested as the name says are infected beings whom are mutated they range from exploding enemies kamikazes ancient whom can heal their allies and infested dogs whom are fast with a strong attack,-1
the voice that i keep forgetting the name ofmadeapun,-1
not going to play this game for a week just because of that voices pun,0
dont even think about it kiddo,0
i dont have enough time atm to get my masters degree in warframe sadly,1
my critique still stands tho this game is way too complicated and just too much of everything,6
the fairly weak tutorial can be supplemented with a trip to the wiki,4
the only downside i can think of is the need of platinum money youll have to purchase with actual money,25
ignore the metagame score it deserves much more,6
in terms of criticisms one aspect of the game that some players may find frustrating is its steep learning curve,-1
warframe has a lot of systems and mechanics that can be difficult to understand and master particularly for new players,1
additionally some players may find the games grindheavy gameplay to be tedious,3
i hate this game,0
i like nothing about it,0
however there is only  problem with this game in my opinion this problem seems to occur in most free to play games,2
sure put hours on end to farm the parts and make your new weapons and warframes etc but each warframe weapon etc needs a slot to be placed in within your inventory and guess what that costs real money to get more hahahahaha what a messed up catch sure its not as expensive as buying the thing you want in the first place but its still really cheeky on the devs part,1
letting people get whatever they want for free only to spend cash for space in their iventory to aquire this so called free whatever you are building  oh and when you build the stuff for free it does take real hours to be made just another set back for some people me,-1
but besides that little cheeky issue with having to buy slots to put the stuff you want for free in i have absolutley nothing bad to say about warframe,1
if you are a player that doesnt like spending real money on games you already bought then i dont think youd like this too much but other then that d absolutley i recommend this,5
i hate this game,0
install this,-1
ive been playing warframe for well over two years now yes it is grindy and yes it will require a lot of your time,1
may cause addictiongood game,12
awsome game all i found was my firewall had blocked it so it wouldnt work,-1
edit  im broke,0
when it comes to its gameplay and narrative warframe always seems to chuck you into the deep end,1
its a challenging game to crack even with hundreds of hours under my belt i can still feel overwhelmed by how much game there is to unpack,-1
this mostly handsoff approach in getting you acclimated can sometimes manifest feelings of aimlessness,-1
and its magnified when it becomes apparent that there isnt a traditional endgame to work up to,-1
if you dont apply the correct mods and buffs to your character it can often stop you in your tracks at some inconvenient moments in your progression,-1
these resources are a big help but its disappointing how often you have to use them as opposed to the game teaching you the same information,4
this repetition can create a recurring feeling of dj vu throughout and there were times when this left me feeling exhausted after an extended play session with the game,0
along with nightmare challenges harder versions of previously completed levels several missions even remix past stages by including multiple enemy factions within one level making some standard objectives far more hectic,7
unfortunately the pvp activities come across as exceedingly basic and clunky compared to the core pve experience,26
lots of items lots of warframes and lots of killing,1
i hate this game,0
its not the best game but theres something in this game that makes me go back again and again and again,0
but then the novelty starts dying,0
dont get me wrong you still love them but the sex is getting kinda repetitive,0
its easy to play this game for  minutes or an hour and say i dont know what im doing,0
or this game is bland and generic,-1
as i said before the game is a diamond in the rough and there are some obnoxious sections or situations the game might put you through,4
for example the drop rate for certain rare materials is ultra low meaning youll be grinding on a level until you get the materials you need making so some stages very redundant,3
or youll find out you need to clear a specific level with a squad yet nobody breathes on that particular level youre trying to get through which makes waiting painful at times,-1
nobody will read my review so i will eat  tablespoon of ketchup for every like this gets,-1
warframe is end real life,1
children in africa get more food than i get plastids,-1
product received for free  i hate this damn game,23
the market ingame is a noob trap,-1
the grind for high level loot has been reduced so much that the new game plus star map with harder difficulty is where most people go to spend their time once they feel they finished the base star chart,3
just fix the store interface tho everything looks like its only p,2
product received for free  i wrote a total bs,23
still great game though but comes with a hefty price of sacrificing your left leg in order to progress,5
if you do not like grinding a lot then this game is probably not for you,3
should be called farming simulator instead due to all the farming you do,11
the gameplay itself is fun too but the levels are repetitive and it gets grindy unless you pay,-1
product received for free  sunk cost fallacy,23
some great ideas railjacks archwings modding trees and unlocks counteracted by some awful ones like the operator mode  which nearly singlehandedly made me quit the game altogether,-1
id even pay for a version of warframe that didnt need or use the operator  i despise it that much,1
also frankly bizarre lore and increasingly convoluted background stories that i am simply aloof to,14
in fact the last quest i completed without the faintest idea of what i had just done or the consequences of that,14
the enemy ai is beyond stupid  made worse when you use a silent weapon alongside a stealthy frame like loki,-1
hes been one of the og units from the very beginning so theres very little excuse to make the enemies so oblivious to the fact that they have just witnessed him impale three colleagues to the wall and they just stand waiting their turn to be shot,-1
lightbulb moments in gaming have rarely been as rewarding,3
no life it almost every day,0
now i had loads of fun until i got scammed and went in to negative platinum due to stolen platinum i received,25
from that point out i wont get any support except if i pay another  euro to get me back in game,-1
i already spent   i probably will stay locked out for a good year or  as i refuse to pay for being scammed or find new game  be aware while game is great there is no support or help from devs and you will see this in many posts regarding customer support,-1
it took few months and several attempts to contact them but at least they didint left me out cold,0
also dont belive the myths,13
unless you seriously dislike games of this style you should have warframe in library,1
gets first prime goes to relay to show off sees everyone else looking cooler than you get jealous copy the others and get their frame still not cool enough quits,-1
then this game is not for you,0
it will make you hate rng with a deep burning passion,11
warframe was here in the beginning early s and will probably be here long after were all dead and gone,1
real money dont really change anything  just make the game faster for making itens and etcgood in the theory  but after some time its get boring,5
they make some really nice events  but even with some friends i dont have pacience to play,4
not theif hoo hah hoo hoo hay,0
has become an absolute mess of bugs,2
devs ignoring community and player feedback at large pushing their vision despite obvious flaws see discussion of the kuva lich system numerous bugs content isles frequent nerfs of every popular item etc,2
they are ignoring that they are not a small time indie project anymore,2
no quality testing whatesover,2
but i can confirm the recent review bombings is because meta slaves are butt hurt is all,6
but like try to find some friends to play it with so youre not stuck reading wiki pages for  years just to learn all the stuff this game refuses to spell out,4
also dont blow your starting plat on garbage weapon slots and frame slots are the way to go,1
player driven economy drives a lot of players away due to other game experiences,-1
my friends hate me now,0
it has nothing to do with money its about your life,5
by the end of it we still had no idea what was happening,-1
but the maps can get a bit repetitive sometimes and if it does go to a new planet,7
still kinda saddened that the quests to unlock the relay are boring and easy to do except the one boss mission,7
never have i ever faced a more cancer boss fight ever,-1
had to get help to even do it cause i ran out of amo the first try,-1
his hitbox is too tiny and he moves too much for you to be able to hit him,22
if all bosses are like him then im just gonna never play again cause his fight was near impossible to do,-1
if your comin back from a long break just say no to doing that  relay boss fight mission its cancer alone and hardly bearable with someonenote i did use a bow,-1
it was a stealth game where fighting more than like  enemies meant certain death  somewhere around ten years later you play as an avatar of abject misery chaos slaughter and destruction given material form,-1
edit  hours  to  have been mediocre,0
send help,0
this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube,-1
i cant believe that this game is free i cannot reccommend this game anymore,9
grind people hear the word grind and that instantly gives you a very negative thought about a game,3
is that even a challenge,-1
this was the other thing that made me not want to try this game,0
i am kinda burnt out on mmos atm,-1
i would not call this game an mmo,-1
original review was all about how to make platinum  good luck making platinum in the game all ways of getting decent amounts have been nerfed with microtransactons,25
badass space ninjas with guns,10
this game is eh,0
grinding for gear and resources can make you question your life choices,3
brain rot is real,0
gg no laifu anymoar,0
literally zero percent,0
good combat good graphics but the story is kind of lacking,14
i mean just look how many hours i sank into this,0
i regret none of them,0
this is my favorite waste of time and couldnt see my self enjoying any other free to play out there anymore than what this game gives,-1
if you aint framin your lamin brah,0
just dismissed it as another free to play game previously and never gave it a second look,-1
only real criticism i have for this game is that there isnt a lot of ingame direction,-1
run please this game has taken up my life please send help,0
okay as of lately people salty about the aoe nerfs are review bombing the game the games quality hasnt changed its just a massive number of people being salty about a skill issue,6
how is this game free,9
this game is grindy and buggy like none other,3
the new player experience leaves much to be desired,4
many of the mechanics are rusty and clunky,3
i have spent way more money in this game than i ever have in a paid game but not once did i feel like i had to pay to win,5
i wish there was a maybe button not just like and dislike,-1
but the grind fest that is its killing it the bugs too,-1
i have stopped playing this game a few months ago due to the slow progres and some bugs  crash and freeze,2
the quest was  hours of showing what the devs can do then releasing you back into a game thats unchanged since  or so left with more disapointment than ever,14
not a single promising element from the quest stayed after you finished it,14
worst thing is the quest is not even replayable yet will problably be in the future tho,14
they teased something important and killed it off before it was even released,14
they have clearly proven now they can not do better,-1
this game is not going in a good direction,0
stay away if you want to save yourself some frustration,0
but once you have gone through the content it will become extremely frustrating,4
unfortunately you will realize that the developers will not meet your expectations and you will slowly start to love the game but hate the devs,2
people tend to be extremely toxic towards other games though which makes perfect sense with what i stated above,-1
by that you go around killing different factions gathering their resources to build more weapons to kill them all again,-1
its a loop and if you dont like the gameplay or grinding than this game has nothing for you,3
grineer an empire of cloned soldiers who are genetically decaying and who youll probably be fighting the most,10
they are heavily armored and prefer brute force,8
corpus a conglomerate of merchants who do whatever they can for a profit,-1
they are infected by a virus from an old war and kill whatever gets in their way,-1
there are constant wars over which is better but it usually boils down to personal preferance,1
you use all your abillities weapons and powers along with three other tenno to run around maps and kill everyone in sight,8
well my answer is a complete no,0
not the best game for you,0
if you dont like it no money lost,5
ive almost spent  hours and that pales in comparison to some of my friends,0
then you skip meals or bedtime,0
your weekends vanish and you have no idea where they went,0
then you start skipping work then mortgage payments because you need plat,5
im rioting,0
stay as far away as you can from this game it will consume you,-1
no dlc and microtransaction scams and no loot box,-1
look at them they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16
tenno use the keys but they are mere trespassers,15
i was cut in half destroyed but through its janus key the void called to me,21
we cannot blame these creatures they are being led by a false prophet an impostor who knows not the secrets of the void,13
behold the tenno come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm,19
forever bound to the void,18
the tenno are lost and they will resist,20
but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
so i have  hours on this game which is nice but this game can suck the soul out of you there are barely any paywin elements beside completing the consturction of an item for ingame currency and trading in the marketplace,5
to be honest i had a few pals suggest warframe to me and even though it was free to play it just didnt seem my thing,1
i thought it mostly was a fps which i am shockingly awful at but its really so much more,-1
out of all of the characters i cannot say that any of them are bad,14
there is no reason to ever need to buy platinum,25
that mentality is usually what i see from people with that opinion of warframe,1
this has gone under fire quite a bit recently and i would like to address it,-1
there is a problem with new players trying to pick up the game,4
there is not a lot of tutorial information to show you what you need to do right away,4
in short all games have their shortcomings and warframes development team actively tries to fix those as they become apparent,1
id advise against starting,4
or do i dont care   update game has nearly ruined my life on several occasions,0
aside from cosmetics there are nothing that you cant get without a little bit of  min effort and not a single cent of money involved,-1
this game is repetitive and grindy but if you let yourself get sucked in you will find yourself playing countless hours on it,-1
the one gripe i had is that it seems to lack an overall objevive,-1
if you dont play other games or dont have a life thats the game for you,0
one majar issue you can only play online,2
if you lose your inernet connection during a mission the game kicks you out and everything you collected will be gone,7
the game is also pretty bugged from time to time but its rarely gamebreaking,2
why are these fools still breathing my air,13
edit  these fools are still breathing my air,13
this is a game that makes all those weird suggested features on forums for other games seem tame,2
dev reply i mean that seems a little limited,2
i dont get this game anymore,0
unfortunately most weapons have a clear best build but many still have several different builds to choose from,1
their company was on the brink of collapse before this game and they turned it around ez,-1
product received for free  i committed several war crimes in this game,23
its grindy and really really addictive,3
though these are really the only complaints i can see to this game after having played it for quite a long time and as far back as to needing stamina,-1
i dont know what to say about this game it boring at first since it a game that required alot of time to play and learn once u get used to it  its addicted,0
helpful player base,4
this will burn you out fast if you rush stuff,-1
this is not for the faint of heart if you press that download button prepare to be in for the longhaul,-1
because warframes rng will break your moral constantly yet suck you back in,1
if you are into third person shooters wallrunning shooting the crap out of aliens with your friends  or by yourself  upgrading all of your weaponry killing enemies with stealth or a direct attack slicing them in half with your blade look no more,8
and its a much less polished game,-1
this game is a fun game that game is game    this game took my life from me and i have nothing to show of it other then  warframes,1
grind the same mission a few hundred times to get what you want craft gear realise there isnt any content entertaining or challenging enough to use said gear repeat,-1
great for new players at times but goes downhill pretty quickly,4
product received for free  this cause a rift to form between me and my family that has also caused irreversible damage in my marriage but it was all worth it,23
i hate warframe its my favorite game,1
i do not recommend this game because the developers are lackluster at times turning back on promises and leaving content lacking or less than it could be,2
player suggested content goes by the waysaid fan creations are gutted and good ideas are left half constructed and severely lacking,-1
i turned into a cyborg ninja and murdered several fleets of aliens,10
i have a slight feeling im a raging racist in this game,0
im killing everything that isnt human,0
but its not user friendly for beginners who are deeply fresh into it best advice have a friend whove played for some time and seasoned,4
a little bit time consuming,-1
free to play is usually a phrase that inspires some degree of reluctance and it usually begs the question alright where are the microtransactions this time,9
the bad while the community is good they are sometimes slow and or do not accept changes in gameplay or new mechanics,2
bugs and simple features can take years to be fixed due to the way the game evolves,2
no hand holding good for those gamers who prefer not to be riddled with tutorials,4
bad for those players who prefer a straight explaination of all the ingame systems,2
bad for those who want things right away,-1
this game will eat a lot of your time,-1
if you cannot spend the time to learn the mechanics or you are unwilling to spend a hundreds of hours of playing,0
this game is not for you,0
can be hard to get into because of the lack of tutorials and complexity though,4
the stand out changes are  melee  still getting used to it not sure i like it i really liked using melee as a primary weapon and the loss of channeling really hurt my build,1
cons  desperate need of a proper endgame,-1
after around thousand hours more or less you will feel the content drought i know i said this game keeps getting updates but there are times where you feel there isnt enough,2
but thats probably because you put too much time in the game and besides you have to spent alot of hours to get to this point,0
bad newplayer experience,4
the game will not hold your hand and it wont tell you what to do next,-1
i have a friend whos kinda dumb and couldnt even figure out the basics even though the game told him in the tutorial,4
this game is not perfect mainly because of its cheer size and attempts in a variety of different forms of gameplays,-1
bugs exist but nothing that will make you curse,2
boy what am i doing with my life,0
honestly i never payed attention to it when i first installed it because of my friends telling me to do so,-1
i had nothing to do one month later and the warframe addiction plugin in my brain got fully installed,1
theres those game that comes once in a blue moon youll hate it you burned by it but you will see how passionate the developer about the game how much the ambition put into it while other game played it safe and milking you with dlc and sequel,2
now its becomes a journey  and you are missing out,0
started early dropped due to my gpu not supporting it anymore,-1
warframe is a game that is hard to get into,1
why is this game free,9
but like most games it has its problems and one of those problems are devs that dont test there patches prior to release,2
they always fix  things they should have fixed  years ago and then break  working thing to do it,2
i dont like children thats bad on me but being forced to play one is bad on them,-1
i see the lotus and her big bulging tts and then back at my  year old boy bodied female and ask why arent they smart enough to sell puberty on the market,-1
i also dont understand why auction houses have existed for years in the mmo community yet this game fails to bring it to us and its one of the bigger flaws that needs to be taken care of,-1
vaulting is annoying yes it presents oppurtunity,-1
but it also takes away from new players and collectors who dont want to spend a billion platinum on a ember prime,25
i feel stupit,0
some times it can be very adictive,-1
it shouldnt be free i think,9
life force depleting,0
nothing to live for but mr,0
dont play this game if you have a life k thx,0
at the time i could not play it due to my computer being a horrible hp laptop,-1
the first account i made was kind of a bust,-1
want to sell your soul to rngesus,-1
then there is loads of custimization in this game,-1
also you can own a friggin flamethrower that headshots enemies,8
warframe oohh warframe i cannot tell you how many times ive wanted to quit this game but ive just never had the intent too after thinking about it,1
ive been playing since  and has had alot of fun playing the game im currently cursed by this very underpowered asus laptop and im unable to play warframe for the time being until i finally get enough money to buy a decent computer to start my grind again,1
there are some major things that i dont like about this game tho,0
and one of those things is the foundry i honestly hate it when im building cyphers for a spy mission because i suck at hacking corpus coms,-1
so i have to babysit the foundry for around  minutes to build  cyphers and dont even get me started on the amount of nitain some things need to be built or obtaining vanilla vauban some of the things in this game or a pain in the arse to get but its rewarding in the end,11
sadly i am unable to get excalibur prime as he was one of the frames back in the old days of warframe that was included in the founders pack,1
this game is pretty hard for new players,4
it is pretty grindy,3
dont let this game look like some of those pay to play games,24
fun game but it gets boring after a while,0
that said it does have issues,2
the grind for gear is everlasting and public matchups tend towards toxicity,3
repeatitive combat can wear you down and the learning curve to master the game is a long one,0
i held off playing it for such a long time because i thought it would be bad since its free to play,0
it used to be very bad but has since been more and more refined by the devs,2
youre going to scroll down these reviews and find a lot of negative ones written by people with more hours into the game than any other game youd ever pay for,6
wallet warrior problems platinium is way too expensive this is my complaint about it cause damn  plat for  bucks damn thats expensive,-1
tutorial the tutorial is kinda bad well it could be better it guides you trough basic combat doesnt really give you any tips on the advanced stuff for example movement they only tell you how to bullet jump crouch wall jump and so on which most are done simply by tapping the spacebar and then theres the whole mods thing which is barely touched upon which i reminf you is pretty much the most complicated part of the game,4
pvp the pvp aka conclave really feels unbalanced i mean you can go as a total noob who just started the game against max mastery rank players who have thousands of hours invested in it,26
community the community where can i start well it is the least toxic community ever seen so sorry for the caps but they were needed,2
more addicting than heroin,12
warframe isnt anything special,1
my biggest regret is not blasting my money on a founders pack back when i started the game,-1
warframe has always been an odd game for me to recommend to friends because its such an unusual game,1
i could go on to explain to you how the gameplay is fast paced and exciting and yet how there are always bugs with every big new update that releases for the first  weeks etc etc,2
warframe  ninjas play for free  especially since update   press x to ninja  you might not like the game but thats just because you dont like rd person ninjas melee combat magics and scifi,1
now make it rd person and add in a whole load more weapons from magnums to assault rifles to boomerangs with spikes,8
but hey if you are complaining about a little work for a lot of profit then be lazy and sit there and not get anything done,5
dont forget the feeling of waking up in a cryocapsule and realising that there are very few left of your nation if any and everyone else in the universe hates you,0
warframe is one of those games that defies its genre and any other type of catagorization,1
one needs to only play after a big patch hits to see this,2
its monetization is nothing if not fair and its developers will make you question what it means to develop a game,-1
honestly theres no good way to describe this game seeing as it keeps changing with every update,2
its one of those games in which your think at first wtf am i doing,0
she left me,0
its even worse when building new warframes to try out new abilities youre talking at least a four day process for one of those,1
actually do not recommend but i do,-1
especially if you want to feel dead inside after a thousands of hours of farming,11
itll kill ya,0
my life is in ruin,0
the grind is daunting to most casual players who just pick up the game this goes for the ingame market as well,3
they know their brains just cant handle it like its gonna explode,-1
all the hardships that an old player got will think oh godthis game progression systems badi have to find a new player and help him,4
and most of the player base do not see this as a reason of why de do not update its progression system,2
it has its ups and downs but at the end of a long day of shooting grineer i can wind down with some mining and fishing and wonder if ill ever be able to get that one drop from a bounty,-1
update is it sad that fortuna was the thing i was looking forward to the most out of everything copming out this year,-1
learning curve is quite steep and it takes a lot to understand how the game and its mechanics work,4
reviews of a game should never be done this far in  you loose perspective,6
hell i quit playing because i didnt like the direction it was going,0
if you see a review for this game with a thumbs down and look at that persons time  and it says literally hundreds of hours and the game is free  ignore them,6
warning if you get addicted easily stay away from warframe,1
i almost wish id never started playing,0
why am i still here,0
i honestly cant even fathom why i played so much of this game,0
it is one of the least rewarding nonsensical games ive played and i play destiny  ffs  edit i lied game fun d,-1
forget about lotus,-1
fun game lots of stuff to do but if you cant handle grinding or working for any ammount of time on things this game is not for you,3
thid game is pure cocaine if you like to grind and surf wiki pages with a community that does not have time to be cancerous cuz they already spending way to much time grinding or surfing wiki pages,12
you have so many weapons it could be considered a war crime,-1
the only criticism i have for this game is the high price of ingame currency platinum,25
posted january  still not got the hate blueprint,2
well this game doesnt really need a review,6
d sadly i wanted gauss warframeand i dont think i ll get it any time sooner,1
should be renamed into warcrimes tbh,1
help  rip my life,0
its actualy not pay to win,24
good game to waste your life playing,0
this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube,-1
has a bit of grinding but it doesnt make the game any less enjoyable,3
a game that you can waste all your time to farm farm farm and farm farm farm,11
makes me wanna die but in a good way,0
dispise lots of people saying this games pay to win platnium premium currency is still easily obtained by trading items any player can obtain,25
i need to stop,0
i hate my life,0
did i ever tell you the definition of insanity,0
insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and over again expecting things to change,-1
would waste life again,-1
dislike pvp,26
it seems like a good game but i dont think ive had enough time to write a proper review,6
i have seen many reviews recently from people who have played thousands of hours as i have of this game recommending against it and bad mouthing it,6
i still find these reviews from these people to be valid if a bit frustrating,6
the game itself has numerous issues and some small but persistent bugs not including big bugs from major releases that tend to get patched very quickly after updates launch as well as a gameplay loop that can be a bit grindy,2
all of these points are valid but do not make the sum of the game as a whole a negative experience,0
every game out there has its problems and while these problems should not be ignored they are understandable,2
cons warframe is terribly buginfested,1
the main chat loves to freeze from time to time the ui can get stuck missions wont start and many other problems might appear,2
id say these kind of bugs dont make the game unplayable but sometimes really get on your nerves and take away from your fun,2
the devs really gotta do something about that since warframe is already out for some time and this serious amount of bugs shouldnt be present after that,1
the game gets quite repetitive after a while due to the fact that all of the missions just repeat and the only thing new about each planet is the level tileset and different ressources you are able to obtain there,7
this might be a very bad thing depending on the type of player you are,4
in other games i have always lost interest after collecting the th kodo wiener  sooo,-1
on the other hand you might get bored pretty damn fast due to its repetitive gameplay and the amount of grinding you have to do in order to craft new items,-1
depending on the type of player you are youre going to have tons of fun with warframe or going to quit after  hours saying jesus this is so boring  having written all this the only thing left to say is,1
having played this game since the early days i can honestly say there are times the grindy aspects of this games can get too much for me and ill stop playing for some time,3
whether its due to the developers constant updates the fun of getting a prime part youve wantes for ages or simply running missions with a mate this game has yet to cease to entertain me,2
pain nothing more,0
cant describe in words the lovehate relationship i have with this game,0
everything that global agenda shouldve been in actuality,-1
dont do this to yourself,0
i apparently never reviewed this well thats awkward,6
update its unbelievable that its a fp game,-1
guilty pleasure which makes me cry,-1
a repetitive game may not be for you,0
however after about an hour or two the devs really just throw you to the wolves,2
at this point he lost interest a problem much of new players experience unfortunately,4
the game mechanics are confusing the weapon mods and character mods can be really hard to understand such as how weapon damage is increased but at the same time can negatively effect a stat or what the hell is a status effect etc etc fortunately for the community there are guides and howto forums and videos all over the place,4
okay so it really sounds like i am just totally dogging on this game,0
just to talk and kill things,0
almost takes away the pain of not being loved,-1
i would post a review but it hasnt dropped for me yet,6
honestly if you dont like to put more than  hours into a game dont play this if you do its a solid pve grind game,3
become a fashion diva and murder everyone,-1
not very good,0
walking the new guy threw the endgame is not fun,-1
compleated the second dream quest and realy got into it super adictive and not very repeditive i highly sugest this to any scifi geeks like myself,14
it however may look boring as it is often reptitive,0
you might be overwhelmend at first but failure is not going to hinder you in any way,-1
you can pay real money to buy any frame or weapon but out of all my hours spent the only situations where i spent money for stuff i could get for free was to avoid a bit of grind that wasnt very stable rng based too challenging and time spending,5
if you dont think this is tight get out of my face,0
dont like space ninjas,10
dont like that,0
giant lazers,-1
this game got my pregnant,0
the support staff isnt very reliable and they need to test their events before releasing,2
look at them they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16
tenno use the keys but they are mere trespassers,15
i was cut in half destroyed but through its janus key the void called to me,21
we cannot blame these creatures they are being led by a false prophet an impostor who knows not the secrets of the void,13
behold the tenno come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm,19
forever bound to the void,18
the tenno are lost and they will resist,20
but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
quite often host migration can get annoying,2
tons of weapons warframes addons cosmetics pets sentinels quests side quest storylines thumbs up for mastery rank tests they are gonna get you mad and angry sometimes,1
if you havent played this game yet youre a dingus,0
consthese really arent cons for me but they might be for some of you   repetitive in some way,-1
all your questions are hidden deep inside and you must perform extremely difficult finger movements to locate them,0
this website is still in beta and does not have everything yet,2
dont rush its never going work out for you,-1
look at them they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16
tenno use the keys but they are mere trespassers,15
i was cut in half destroyed but through its janus key the void called to me,21
we cannot blame these creatures they are being led by a false prophet an impostor who knows not the secrets of the void,13
behold the tenno come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm,19
forever bound to the void,18
the tenno are lost and they will resist,20
but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
it so addicting kill kill kill,12
this game can get very tiresome fast unless you form a clan or join one and do missions with your clan mates,7
command a highly armed and extremley dangerous warframe as you cut shoot and leap through a variety of levels and enemies,8
fight off the rampant infestation,-1
it still suffers heavily from confusing ui design and ancient progression systems which can really turn off a newcomer without any guidance,-1
takes a longggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg time to do so due to rng though,11
whereas some items can unfortunately only be farmed and grinded for,11
everyone gets to suffer the time investment to earn those things,-1
machine guns that slice enemies to pieces,8
a good number of systems that make up the meat of the game are barely explained if at all,-1
this doesnt really bother me too much but im sure some people will be put off by playing the same mission  times in a row just to get the something they already have in abundance instead of the one piece they need,7
many items in the item shop are priced quite highly though which  at least in my opinion  makes them not worth the money,5
at the time of this writing the plains of eidolon update is the most recent patch and i have to say it made me take a break from the game because the new openwordly area lacks pretty much everything that actually makes the game itself great and adds a lot of unnecessary garbage that departs heavily from the kill stuff as awesome as possible formula,2
it seems that de has decided that that is how the game is going to evolve from this point forward which i personally find sad,2
i am still very much not a fan of focussing on open world content but they have improved the way they approach it a bit,2
however they once again added more and more stuff to the game that barely integrates with the rest,2
nobody will read my review so i will eat  tablespoon of ketchup for every like this gets,-1
reminds me of vindictus diabloish style loot system instanced missions and cutting people in half,-1
of course there will always be rotten apples but thats anywhere,-1
its like meth its fun to do every once in a while with friends and then take a long break but partaking in it for weeks months or even years at a time as a normal part of your routine will result in severe problems with your prefrontal cortex and social matters,12
the game doesnt give everything good at the start some of it comes later,-1
bad new player experience they are working on it though long wait times for weapons and frames,4
customer support is somewhat slow at times,-1
the amount of things to do is quite overwhelming,-1
to sum up it isnt for everyone it is hard to get into but hard to get out of,4
if you like pretending to be a demigod thats shrouded in murderous intent meandering through a solar system full of horrifically corrupt politicians apathetically deadpan mad scientists and mindless dispensable biomechanically engineered clones you might like it,-1
my wife left me,0
jokes on her though i spent all of my money on plat so she didnt get a dime in the divorce,0
this game isnt noobfriendly,0
unless you have a friend whos a veteran youre gonna have trouble getting use to the mechanics weapons enemies and levels,-1
however it can still be a tad grindy at times and several of my friends found the beginning of the game too hard a hurdle for them and quit early on due to the upper levels carrying them through the low levels and making the game boring for them so if youre going to enjoy this game its a necessity that you dont play public matchmaking,3
your own bloody warship,-1
various types of mission  online coopmultiplayer    no linux support,-1
grinding is way overblown in this game now  many time consuming or time locked events  items are way too expensive for what they are  mission map navigation is very confusing  cant play some missions because nobodys playing them impossible to play alone,7
no linux support,-1
literally unplayable,-1
end game is lacking but the devs are constantly updating the game,2
addendum  more hours in and the first sentence is already terrible,0
this game is garbage why,0
this game is nonsense do not play this game for your own safety,0
that man will hunt you down if you encounter him,22
its really hard to describe or fully put into words,-1
cons repetitive honestly its hard to fully enjoy it when you do the same thing over and over its more like a grind and farm,-1
its hard to imagine them not charging people for this game,24
the coop play is a bit lackluster compared to the single player experience though because the quality of gameplay depends on which user is hosting,-1
so if the user has a very slow upload speed you could be thrown out of the game or fail the mission because of that,7
now i know what youre thinking every free to play game is pay to win,24
spending money in this game doesnt give any gameplay benefit over those who dont,5
btw can be abit grindy update i bought plat is not grindy anymore,-1
its a fun game with a lot of flaws,-1
the only bad thing about the game is the fact that you should grind all the time,3
send help,0
i cant play this with my elite powerful world busting gtx  anymore so might as well jerk off to wild life documentarys,-1
this game sucks,0
ruined my life,0
i have never been more alone in my entire life and this game is making it worse,0
its about them using all of that to kill space orcs space zombies and members of a space cult with too much money to spare,10
i mean look at them they all just want to live in peace in space but these really rude warframes,10
they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16
tenno use the keys but they are mere trespassers,15
i was cut in half destroyed but through its janus key the void called to me,21
we cannot blame these creatures they are being led by a false prophet an impostor who knows not the secrets of the void,13
behold the tenno come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm,19
forever bound to the void,18
the tenno are lost and they will resist,20
but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
at times i thought the devs had let me down only to find out they were making something way better,2
digiral extremes just deserves nothing less,-1
some may say wf is repetitive i say they are looking at the wrong aspect you want repetition you go play cod,0
no two weapons in this game feel the same,8
no two warframes are even remotely close to the same,1
so sure enemies may be simular is alot of aspects but when you have  ways to kill him repeatedly who cares,-1
garbage,0
do you like ass,0
first of all let me start by saying that this game is definitely not for everyone,0
also the game is currently not very friendly to newcomers you will login for the first time play the first  missions and then you will find yourself walking around having no clue on how to progress,4
after playing warframe for nearly  years with some breaks in the middle i still cannot find a game with better combat mechanics,1
do you want to jump and propel yourself like a spear to shoot a dude in the face at pointblank range,8
do you want to to turn your enemies into pincushions by throwing dozens of kunais at them while wall running,8
do you want to jump from a threestore building to land on top of someones head with your giant steel hammer,8
do you just want to stay still and watch your giant mutant alien pet rip and eat your enemies alive,-1
dude you are a bit creepy but feel free to do it,0
regarding the cons of this game the only two flaws i can think of besides the ones described at the beginning are pvp and the archwing system,-1
pvp in warframe is not really popular there isnt a high amount of players actively playing it and the rewards you can get from it are mostly to be used only in pvp,26
regarding the archwings im not even going to get into details they just suck and they should never have been added to the game,-1
one last thing you may have noticed some negative and i mean really negative reviews written by people who have insane amounts of playtime some of them with more than k hours,6
this is something that i never saw in any other game at least not at the amount you can find here,-1
i apologize in advance for my terrible spelling as you may have noticed english is not my main language,0
absolutely bloated with content and with a billion weapons and warframes,1
i also love playing repetitive missions thousands of times in hopes that i get the stupid church organ room to build my gay little bard ninja,7
if you are a player who wants an endgame with good storyline highend graphics  hrs of playtime then this game is not for you,-1
ps very addictive for achievement freaks,12
horribly addicting,12
everytime i boot this up i get a tingly feeling in my crotch,0
not because it makes me happy but because my unborn children know they will never be spawned thanks to this timesink and try to escape,0
kill me,0
warframe is a fast paced fp game that rewards long time players over buying ingame items,1
warframe does have problems though with some of the best content being far to hard to get even for long time players and balancing on weapons and frames is a very rocky path with some of the best content being reduced to mastery fodder,1
i shot a guy in the face with elemental blast damage and he flew into the stratosphere,8
im losing a social life,0
this game is evil,0
product received for free  i have played this game quite a bit but the most recent fortuna update killed it for me,23
i am sad that i cant enjoy this game the way it deserves,-1
im sorry warframe youve gotten to hard for me,1
dont listen to meta critic they suck,6
when i first started playing in  this game was very bare compared to how it is today only the corpus tilesets were availible for maps the grineer spoke english there were only about a handful of frames wepaons and your character would just float in space in between missions,7
i hate this bad game,0
i stopped playing cause i felt burnt out by the game and that it wasnt really respecting my time with it,0
remember this was a while ago where de will nerf things that are the most used they probably still do that huh and theyre way of making enemies difficult would make them bullet sponges,8
so why am i still recommending this even though i had a pretty bad experience in the past,-1
i want to be proven wrong on the statements that i have made that it doesnt respect your time,-1
this game is really grindy and having meaningful rewards is close to none,3
i will like to state this again my experience was a while ago and its pretty unfair for me to not recommend this game when i havent really followed the updates and havent really and what happened in the past cant reflect of its todays product,2
then why make a review of the game,6
cause i really care about this game and its development but over time ive seen it losing players because of certain decisions but now im seeing it getting players and more positive reviews i just dont know if i want to go through the whole process again and be disappointed,6
edit  why did i even wasted my life on this and review is cringe,6
the fp model in this isnt bad although they really stick it to you in buying better weapons the starter weapons are kind of weak and its a tough time to get the material to craft better ones if you dont have a good squad to take you through the latter half of the missions,1
my only complaints is that the free run mechanic feels a little hit or miss although i may just suck at it right now and i wish the ingame chat text was bigger,2
this would usally send people away,-1
also dont trust the metacritic review its extremely outdated cause warframe is a growing game so alot of the problems they had are fixed,1
sent jays disciple and im right now wielding an executioners axe like its a dual bladed sword sent jays disciple yep sent jays disciple its still somewhat terrible if you dont have invisibility drakosmasher lol sent jays disciple theres also guns where you can mod sent jays disciple to a  bullets a sec monster sent jays disciple with up to  bullets a round drakosmasher sweet sent jays disciple chainsaw hands drakosmasher really,8
no salt in this game,0
on the flip side warframe can end up feeling like too much of a grind sometimes,1
now that may sound pretty bad to some but in my opinion the fun you can have using the warframes and weapons you get mitigates some of the annoyance of the grind,1
im very poop at this game but i still like it,0
its like cocaine but worse because its free,12
i want to die,0
so if you dont like grinding very much its not going to be much fun,3
ill kidnap  children before i let this company die,0
although that whole flying thing is kinda iffy atm,0
dont let this game take your life,0
realistically its a really repetitive game with you requiring to obtain a variety of resources to build something only to collect more resources to build something else from a variety of missions that can seem neverending at times,7
product received for free  this game gets very repetitive at first,23
my other gripe about this game is that the crafting system and market isnt really explained well and can be confusing to first timers,11
but once you are able to learn and play you will be sucked in this game for hours on end and you wont want to stop,0
warning the first  quest of the story as of  are quite boring for some as they were made before the cinematic quests were introduced,14
concerning the pay to win illusion no you do not need to spend any real world money on this game,5
i was stand offish about this game a long time and regret not playing it sooner now,0
id give this a middle rating if i could i have a love hate relationship with it,0
ii either feel way overpowered or way underpowered i dont like how there are more hordes than powerful single target enemies,-1
too much content ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,-1
why dont you have the game already,9
damn this game is on the grind that fashion frame shouldnt said its about dat plat it should said its about dat grinddddddddddddd grinddddddddddd mad grinddddddddddddddddd  hours a day  days a week nothing but grindddddd im on the grindddddddd my liset it aint a normal liset its a grind liset,3
well all things come to an end,-1
people crying about wukong and aoe nerfs are babies,6
its pretty damn grindy so its great if youre into that not so much if you dont have a lot of time on your hands,3
this game is heroin,12
you youre not sure at least try it wont do you any harm,-1
youll probably get pulled into it like i was,0
this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube,-1
and i thought warframe couldnt get any better,1
crosssave mfs is in the way,-1
almost everything that costs money is either a convenience fee or completely optional cosmetic items,5
some missions can become repetitive especially when grinding for specific resources or items,7
product received for free  dont do it its a one way road,23
hours deep still trapped,18
china is smogfilled orwellian nightmare state with active concentration camps housing  million uyghur people while detaining its own citizens for arbitrary reasons,-1
grindy as all hell but thats ok,3
about  hours in and the grind is not even close to coming to a stop,3
space ninja genocide,10
y u so grindy,3
you may be thinking to yourself but its fp so its prob got some pw or really hard grind in it well it doesnt,3
not to mention the massive hidden story it has dont google it experience it yourself quests like second dream and the war within litterly made me just not believe this game was free,9
liquidate the chilling space capitalists,10
cripple the deteriorating cyborg clone army,10
eviscerate the nasty gribbly horrors,0
murder fellow super assassins cause slaughtering everything else wasnt enough,-1
willing to go through hell and back to obtain absolutely anything,-1
should anything actually go wrong just tell the devs in the appropriate forum,2
i really should slap my past self for not buying a founders pack,-1
not a bad game,0
its just too grindy for me to invest a lot of time into,3
the sad part about this game is the update times i lost my kubrow in a earlier version to this  a lotus mark kubrow first one i got,-1
some people say grinding isnt fun but for me and my friends we can either fish and talk about life or mindlessly grind and get completely disappointed by rngeesus,3
i paid money for games that were much worse,5
dont play this if you easily get severely addicted to things,12
ive read several comments saying that most of the games systems are not explained,-1
i think its a good thing that were not treated like babies who cant understand nothing,16
i must say as well the first few hours are a bit confusing but if u want to understand the game you will just gotta think a bit more than i can expect from some people apparently,-1
thats the only objectively bad point about this game,0
this game is based in a power fantasy youre playing as the most powerful battle machine ever existed so dont come here wanting a challenge like it was a souls like,-1
itll get rough the first time u see an eidolon for example,-1
the community is only comparable with minecrafts,-1
it gets permanently banned and i nor him can play the game again,-1
pathetic  im taking my money somehwre else,5
i wish i had known about this game sooner,0
warframe has its problems with updates bringing a bunch of negatives with the positive additions and fixes,1
overall it is not paytowin,24
what other game lets you jump around in space looking like a literal tank that dressed up as a pink butterfly wielding a microwave gun grinding for materials from space aids monsters,10
this game has three main draws running around as a space ninja cutting people in half playing with up to three friends and a storyline that does not operate on linear time,10
product received for free  even after several patches the game still has major problems with its more recent additions and continues to have no true endgame,23
enough to make a black man cry,0
its still basically the same old grindfest and its still almost impossible to find pickup groups for normal mission progression but with so many new mission types areas enemies factions the archwing which reminds me so much of zone of the enders theres actually a hell of a lot to do,-1
the game still goes out of its way to screw you if you insist on trying to play for free but you can get around if if youre bloodyminded enough,9
i had to uninstall and install this game because of a login glitch,-1
sad,0
let me leave damn it please god let me out of this grind hell help,3
i regret getting this game,0
people either have  or  hours in this game there is no middle ground,0
i simply refuse to waste my life grinding for meaningless stuff with such basic melee and ranged combat,3
grind is evil,3
why cant all online multiplayer games have community like this,-1
according to all known laws of aviation there is no way a bee should be able to fly,0
its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground,0
oan you believe this is happening,-1
sorry,0

those were awkward,-1
dont waste it on a squirrel,0
such a hothead,0
thats why we dont need vacations,-1
so youll just work us to death,0

thats an insane choice to have to make,0
but adam how could they never have told us that,13
why would you question anything,0
youre monsters,0
youre sky freaks,0
you cantjust decide to be a pollen jock,0
you have to be bred for that,-1
thats more pollen than you and i will see in a lifetime,0
its just a status symbol,-1
bees make too much of it,0
it must be dangerous being a pollen jock,0
i never thought id knock him out,0
do you ever get bored doing the same job every day,0
you know dad the more i think about it maybe the honey field just isnt right for me,0
thats a bad job for a guy with a stinger,22
im not trying to be funny,0
youre not funny,0
youre gonna be a stirrer,0
no ones listening to me,0
all the good jobs will be gone,-1
im sorry the krelman just closed out,-1
a bee died,0
another dead one,0

deadified,0
two more dead,0
dead from the neck up,0
dead from the neck down,0
oh this is so hard,-1
oh no,0
youre gonna die,0
youre crazy,0
negative points  none,0
i dont even know why i cant stop playing this game,0
i hate this game,0
as for the graphics engine  it couldnt automatically detect the correct graphical settings and started in a low resolution,-1
you will have no idea what is going on no time to look around,-1
it is very easy to get lost especially if the others have ducked through a grate,4
use your lives lose your play for the day,0
councilor vay hek  tenno are worse than weeds,15
we kill one and three more show up,0
the bad end game what that,-1
competent devs whats that,2
warframe is a great game but it also represents one of the ultimate examples of squandered potential,1
as of  still no end game in sight nothing but endless grind for variants i pose this question what is the purpose of gaining ultimate power if you have no contest worthy of it and all content has long since been trivialized,3
little grindy not enough hours in to give it a proper review yet,6
this game smells like a farm,11
how is this game free,9
worth all of the hours youll waste on it,0
my life wasnt whole before i got to know this gameit still isnt but atleast i have something to kill my time with,0
although i wouldnt recommend the pvp side of the game,26
its not fleshed out just yet and isnt worth it or good enough for me yet,-1
this ride doesnt seem to end,-1
did i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is,-1
you start as a peasant owns nothing but basic tools,11
in the end you end up being a peasant owns everything,11
a third person romp that is best enjoyed in short bursts for the grind is insanity,3
thanks to prime resurgence my family disowned me,0
warframe is a rare gem in the sea of crap that is the fp market,1
seriously what kind of ninjas own pets,10
the only bad thing is that if you own a kubrow they dont have weapons,-1
too sad for kubrow owners,-1
the bad thing is you have to be at least mastery rank  to unlock it get the blueprint and use it,1
its about war,-1
cons i cant find the reverse time button support kinda poo,-1
most games when i take a break i tend to never come back because ive broken free oo,0
the game will run on anything i swear if you were desperate to get the daily sortie done you could play it on a tablet,-1
this game is actually wicked,0
reaction time along with quick and flashy plays arent going to make you good,0
if youre one of those people with serious timeconstraints because of jobs and whatever else you have to deal with in your life you can play the game just dont expect to make huge amounts of progress,-1
rest of review removed as its very outdated by now,6
only down side literaly grind simulator,3
the only issue is the bugs but given that the update literally just came out yesterday ill forgive that,2
product received for free  warframe is one of the most socially destructive games out there in league with maple story satan and whatever that shooting game is with the sapphic erotica chicks who wear bird armor and talk in a goofy british accent,1
if youre still in school do not play this game,0
dont neglect your friends and your school work and your ambitions just because you need to wait all day to grind for grindium to build a grinding grounder to grind grunts into skate cakes,3
chase girls join the military learn to build a house hang out with your family ride a bike across the country anything just get out there and dont touch this game because it will ruin you,0
its a mindless hordeshooter at heart with a massive crazy scifi armory thrown in,1
then much later when youre a seasoned jaded old tenno who cant even find joy in soaring through the rings of saturn with your sweet ass jetpack then you can raise an army of mutant space cats or fight giant sentient timetraveling radioactive treegolems to reignite your murderous passion,-1
constant updates and wellintentioned balance passes will never ever address all the issues in this game it has become an unwieldly beast that digital extremes can no longer control and the rabid community wont let them fix and thats perfectly fine,2
everything dies but at least this game will end with a glorious supernova,-1
being still only in beta there are a few minor bugs that stop it from being one of the top free to play games around,2
this game isnt pay to win its pay to skip content,24
if you think otherwise fight me,0
throw hands if you will  edit  this game is kinda mid,-1
note that im not a player who finds grinding to be tedious so i admit this might be an obstacle to people who want to get into the game right away,3
no no dont ask,0
like doing parkour at high speed while firing off highpowered dangerous weaponry,8
warframe has a reputation for being hard on new players but it really isnt nearly as bad as people make it out to be,1
and while its true the game doesnt do a good job of explaining things  did you know you can make multiple unique blueprints in your foundry at the same time,-1
theres not feeling like you have to get a bunch of busy work done if you dont want to do all that,-1
honestly even though warframe is a very famous game i feel like its still slept on by a lot of gamers,1
i dont know if i like the grind the achievements the repetitiveness or perhaps im somehow not right in the mind,3
i tried this game out of spite for friends ditching me for destiny,-1
cant write too much lotus needs me,0
may confuse new players so i recommend inviting friends because it is not meant to be played alone and it becomes boring,4
honestly i cant recommend this game enogh,0
this isnt a very good representation of astronauts,10
you cant even go to the moon,0
its freaking space ninjas,10
i miss my wife and child  update my wife and child are still misssing,0
needs more salt,0
i dont know how this is free,9
i generally dont like shooters and oftentimes this type of game gives me motion sickness,-1
the microtransactions are kinda weird though but nothing too major unless you like to waste money buying items when its easier and cheaper to go find the components build it and then rush the item,5
but it gets a little repetitive after a while,0
no dad you cant play,0
this is like cocaine,12
some people might say that its not worth it but i do think it is after all its a free to play game where microtransactions are bound to cosmetic items,5
but it gets boring when you experience almost everything in the game and the only thing left is weapon xp grinding to get higher ranks,3
even if you pay it will not last forever,5
after that it is boring,0
how is this even possible in  where every single publisher and developer have become as greedy as they can,-1
look at them they come to this place when they know they are not pure,16
tenno use the keys but they are mere trespassers,15
i was cut in half destroyed but through its janus key the void called to me,21
we cannot blame these creatures they are being led by a false prophet an impostor who knows not the secrets of the void,13
behold the tenno come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm,19
forever bound to the void,18
the tenno are lost and they will resist,20
but i vor will cleanse this place of their impurity,17
no pay to win only thing you can not get through just playing is cosmetic items,5
ive been farming in this game for over  hours,11
it has its flaws and the community can be a pain in the ass sometimes but overall its a good game,-1
man do these guys have ambitions,-1
although after  hours of gameplay itll be grindy as hell and repetitive,3
but there is one downside atleast for the xbox one version you have to grind for a bit to get to where you want to be or you could pay to get things,3
thats the only downside,-1
unlike destiny where you have to grind to get to where you want to be at and spend hours apon hours apon hours playing the same mission grinding over and over over to the point to where you get sick of hearing the characters talk all the time warframe offers at least a couple hundred missions not all have a story line though,7
this game started out as an absolute mess,0
while at start the control seems to way too hard now it seeems decent but way too convinent yet,-1
why is this game free i dont get it,9
parts of the community can be veryvocally toxic but the majority are welcoming and helpful,2
we dont deserve this game and yet they made it free so that we peasants could rise from the mud and finally get what the industry is promising us every day in vain,9
cash shop is fair mostly cosmetics and skip the grind type purchases though if you dont like the grind then this game might not be for you lol,-1
if any developer deserves your money its these guys,2
this game ruined my life,0
this game is like heroin and not in a good way,12
ugh not even going to try and review this anymore,6
if you dont like it youll know pretty quick,0
i can guarantee youll kill more time with this than your average aaa game campaign mode even if you hate it,0
please dont do it to yourself,0
after passing through the egregious screaming clay pit of desolate omission of morality logic and all things in the light a black mass of malicious nine year olds and adults who could only cull back the creeping thoughts of mercy in death with drugs and drink as they torrment themselves in some sadist styled self lashing with this game call league of legends is so very refreshing to find a game thats relaxing fun and has the right stress a game should have to keep you thralled,-1
and cutting up people like celery,-1
my pc isnt the greatest at graphics capability but i can actually play this on high without and fps troubles,-1
game stole my life for a year,0
my only problem is the pp hosting they have,2
if the host is lagging then the enemies lag if the hosts connection dies then it tries to hand it off which takes more than  seconds usually with a full reconnect screen required,2
sometimes it just kicks you out and asks if you want to reconnect to the squad,7
but the gripes i have is that the entry level is massive with most of the weapons and frames being very daunting for new player along with some grind,1
from then on milos is drawn into a maelstrom of unbelievable cruelty and mayhem devised by his employer the director of his destiny,22
vukmir and his cohorts will stop at nothing to complete his vision,22
sadly the devs are a big issue,2
if you look for hard content then you are wrong in this game,-1
everything get even more easy and trivialized at some point and your play time isnt valued,0
warframe is a very cool game to play but it get you bored pretty fast with its endless grind,1
at first the game may come across as overwhelming intimidating and or difficult to grasp as a new player,4
i went into warframe thinking itd just be another orion dino horde,1
play it if u have friends plays it graphics  oh yeaaaaaah controls  oh yeaaaaaah gameplay  oh yeaaaah missions  trash,-1
i wish i had known about this game years ago,0
after all the games ive purchased that werent worth it this one is,5
i need games that are a bit slower and more measured with high fantasy and a good magic system but for some reason warframe just clicks for me,1
is just ridiculous,-1
it is hard to convince friends to give it a try because the new player experience still just doesnt do the game justice in a way that hooks you at the start,4
youd be mad if you give this a negative review ngl,6
flashy and very grindy,3
the new player onboarding can be a little rough,4
dont have much time and just wanna kill stuff in a scifi setting,-1
help i have no idea what i am doing,0
this game makes most modern aaatitles look bad,-1
why are we still here,0
just to suffer,0
just play the dang game,0
my balls hurt,0
this game stole my entire life,0
edit i still think this is a good game at its core but the past few updates have been pretty lackluster and have disappointed me to the point of wanting to step away from the game for a few months and wait for some more interesting content to be added,2
to clarify i still think this game is worth your time ive just grown tired of it due to a mixture of disappointing new content and overall burnout of the game itself,-1
numerous times the developers have purposely removed aspects of the game that are too pay to win and the only reason that the game has survived since  is because the developers actively tweak the games in ways that benefit the game no matter if the players like them or not,-1
product received for free  theres plenty of bugs in the game that make it frustrating to play but besides those small bugs the game is pretty good,23
demois visually was interesting but lacking in every single way,-1
combat wasnt fun the missions were meh mostly due to the lacking combat,7
the warframe elden ring thing did do anything for me havent wanted to play or complete it,1
its mid,-1
i never thought sliding and jumping would be such a means of transportation,8
this game will consume everything to this day my addiction keeps me trapped,12
a strict diet of stupidity tenacity and stubbornness keeps me here every waking moment is consumed by the void,18
its not that great,0
this game should not be free,9
how is this game still free,9
i had my doubts about this game at first,0
actually i sort of rage quitted durring the tutorial,4
people who say it is pay to win could not be more wrong it is not paying only shortens the grind thats all,24
can just charge down hallways and rooms tearing about enemies by the dozen,8
doesnt come without bugs mind you,2
only downside is that devns prefer content over bugfixes because it is a free game and i feel like this balance is quite off,2
certain bugs have been here for years and some can really ruin your day as well,2
plays  days boredstops playing for  yearcomes back to play h non stopwelp how the hell did i think the game was broing,0
i guess i am just trash at this and need to get good,0
so many hours with so little regret,0
addictive as heck,12
ruining my life and im okay with this,0
im dead inside,0
the one time i actually want to get death threats,0
finally tried thisit was a mistake,-1
if you play this you wont regreat the time spend in the game,0
my life is now gone not like i had one before,0
basically you start off as a scrub like any other game,0
or using one of your warframes powers to decimate an entire squad of enemies,8
just know this game is pretty grindy,3
the only main problem this game has is the grind factor,3
but hey if you enjoy being a friggen space ninja and you enjoy murdering things,10
again this game is grindy and requires patienceyknowlikelike a ninjajust give it a try,3
there are a lot of free to play games out there that either feel unpolished or pay to win,9
when you craft things you can rush it with platinum which almost turned me away at first because i thought it would be as annoying as those mobile apps with rush but i got used to it short after and started to barely even notice since i passed the time doing fun missions,7
ive wasted too many hours on this game and im going to waste many more,0
loads of fun and replayability for a game with minimal gameplay modes however if youre a coward when it comes to grinding loot and gear  you should probably just sit in the dark alone and imagine life couldve been like if you were a space ninja,3
very grindy,3
decent game but i dont personally enjoy it,0
warframe is an entirely new asthetic instead of taking cover to dodge bullets you make cover stealth around or even dodge bullets and lasers with your mad ninja skillz,-1
if you are a loner youll probably get bored after some time,0
even though they have made a lot of improvements since i first played back in the beta this game still lacks endgame content,2
and its not even officially out of beta yet,2
though after a while you will get bored of doing the same stuff over and over again,0
warframe has that inevitable mmo feature of draining all your time away,1
everybody i knew was getting bored of me multi or still playing skyrim,0
its missions can be so fast paced that you will loose track of time and if you are like me make other games seem like they are lacking,7
im not going to sit here and tell you its perfect everything has cons,-1
surely has some downsides but nothings ever perfect is it,-1
there are occasional bugs now and then but nothing too bad,2
welcome to the grind and good luck tenno scum,3
even got spare pt to get me a hunhows gift to look like a stalker fangirl,22
its hard to get the similar game like this one,-1
one of the main negative things about this is the grinding,3
the tldr of the game kill things farm stuff grow in power,11
the only major downside imo is power creep,-1
without challenge there is no fun,0
and a personal nitpick  not enough blood,0
