F2P experience is very bad, and the game make no effort to introduce new players.  The PvP community is mildly toxic (it's pretty bad, but not the worst comparing with other competitive FPS). The PvE side is a lot better. It's pretty easy to find friendly players to play together if you know where to find.  The story content is getting better nowadays, but there have been quite a few questionable patches every now and then. The devs are very transparent with the patches and communication with their players.  Edit: Nothing changed. Edited for Steam Awards.",Recommended,2021.12.23,4.0

Destiny 2,Whiskey1dog,"This is a review from a Destiny 1 veteran, written just a few days after the Lightfall expansion has dropped.  Destiny 2 is a first-person shooter with abilities, co-op, pvp, and huge and constantly expanding world. The good parts of this is the best feeling gunplay in the industry, and this is coming from a person who grew up and COD, Halo and tried many, many new FPS shooters to come out in the last ten years. the abilities and builds are constantly changing and powerful, and definitely add to the flavour of the game and truly make Destiny, Destiny. the player versus player is extremely fun, with insane amounts of guns and builds to choose from. Even if Bungie does occasionally screw the balance horribly, but that adds to the experience to an extent. If you want amazing gunplay, awesome and cool abilities, outstanding co-op AND good pvp (although not as big of a focus as the co-op content), then Destiny is definitely for you.  but where are the downsides? I'll tell you. I would say Destiny 2 is an ""easy to learn, hard to master"" type of game. Bungie has put lots of effort and resources into improving the new player experience, and in Lightfall, I think they have finally made a ""good"" new player introduction system. D2 is intricate with many layers of lore, gameplay and buildcrafting, and quests that can overwhelm new players with all the content, with no where to really know where to start. Lightfall's changes only partially solve these problems. Other problems include PVP content draught, FOMO, and no in game LFG system (coming later this year), although Bungie has partially alleviated these problems with Lightfall and previous changes, they are still definite problems the community wants fixed.  Destiny 2 is a great, incredibly fun game especially with friends and I'd recommend the game to anyone who wants THE BEST fps mmo game. impeccable co-op (amazing end game, not like anthem), great pvp, and awesome gameplay. even with the problems new players might have without a friend to guide them, and the other problems I mentioned before, D2 is a fun game with near limitless potential to grow and become better.    You may have heard very negative feedback so far about this expansion. The critiques the community has for the DLC are completely valid and I overwhelmingly agree. The campaign, while fun, was a narrative letdown. However, the quality of life features, the new subclass strand, the difficulty overhaul and seasonal model changes are definitely positive. If people ignore the campaign, I'd say lightfall so far is a very good DLC. as someone who played shadowkeep and beyond light, Lightfall is better. On top of that, beyond light didn't stop evolving and adding content in the first week. After the raid was beaten new content and exotics were released, so I assure you we have definitely not seen all of Lightfall just yet.  This is my first review I have ever put effort into, so I truly hope you enjoyed and found this informative.",Recommended,2023.03.05,3.0

In a game full of cheesey bugs and over powered weapons that get nerfed only to get buffed again later on, there's nothing quite like teaming up with your mates to stretch across the galaxy, kicking ass and taking names. Names of all the cheaters who you can report to Bungie for them to ignore.  You'll be greeted by the kindest of people with random dance parties at the social space, while also getting their tiny tea bags after they one-tap headshot you with some absurd weapon they 'earned'.

Destiny 2,Xander,"As of writing this review, I have played approximately 1600 hours of Destiny 2 over on Battle.net, where the game was previously hosted before moving to Steam.  Destiny 2 is an interesting game, an instanced MMOFPS which certainly isn't a common sight. Just some quick history first, I picked up Destiny 2 upon release back in September 2017. I had not played Destiny 1 over on consoles so this was my first contact with a Bungie game since Halo: Reach. Both Destiny and Destiny 2 had issues in development apparently and Destiny 2 released in a subpar state, at least according to Destiny 2 veterans. Personally, I thought it was fantastic at the time and enjoyed Destiny 2's first year despite the extremely negative reception. Since then, there have been three major DLCs, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, and the year two annual pass containing three minor DLCs, Black Armoury, Joker's Wild and Penumbra. As Destiny 2 enters its third year, the game is transitioning to a free to play model alongside its fourth major DLC, Shadowkeep.  So right off the bat, I want to praise Bungie in their slick gameplay. Halo was renowned for its great gunplay and despite the Halo series being over for a while (games after Reach don't count), Bungie clearly have shown they still have it through Destiny. Destiny's core gameplay of shooting dudes feels fantastic in pretty much every way, from the way the guns handle to the way the enemies move and react. All the guns feel and sound very satisfying, and enemies over the four enemy species are varied enough to change things up pretty frequently. This makes the in the moment gameplay just feel far better than most games I play.  Speaking of sound, Destiny really excels at sound design. The music of Destiny is amazing and really shines in things like the story, dungeons and raids. Notable tracks like Journey or The Hunted just really set the mood perfectly and show that although Bungie no longer has Marty, they can still creat exceptional soundtracks. Sound effects are in the same boat, the musical cue of the Leviathan's castellum doors opening, the telltale ""ting"" of Calus's chalice being shot or the boom of his thunderous claps, the crunch of the killing blow on a cursed thrall, the crack of a golden gun activation, I could go on and on. There's so many sound effects in this game that just feel right and it makes the game so much better.  Onto art direction and graphics, Destiny just looks beautiful honestly. The graphical fidelity might not be quite as high resolution as 2019 titles, but you don't notice it even staring at rocks up close. The direction is incredibly varied, from the forested ruins of the EDZ to the geometrical, artificial terrain of Nessus to the fantastical cliffs of the Dreaming City. Each location has a clear direction and pursues it to the fullest, all the way down to the organic hive infested tunnels on Mars or the dark, eerie depths of the Ascendant Plane. Even the skyboxes are great to look at, and I frequently find myself just watching the clouds roll over the lakes of the EDZ or the spaceship traffic in the tower in the Last City. In short, the art direction is stunning and Bungie does not shy away from ambitious vistas in this game.  Destiny 2's looting looting and gear aspects are pretty simple. There are five tiers of weapons; common (white), uncommon (green), rare (blue), legendary (purple) and exotic (yellow). In contrast to most games, these classications aren't indicative of rarity, instead at low light levels (weighted average of equipped gear levels) commons and uncommons drop, but at high levels commons and uncommons become impossible to drop and most of drops are rare, with the rest being legendary and sometimes exotics. Only legendary and exotic gear is really viable in any way, all other tiers are just for levelling or infusing (levelling up) the legendaries and exotics you like. Speaking of exotics, you can only equip one exotic weapon and one exotic armour piece at once, but they generally change your playstyle with completely new gamechanging perks. Levelling generally consists of doing any activity, raising you light level with random drops until you hit the soft cap, then doing specific activities that reward powerful gear until you hit the hard cap. This is then exceeded to an extent by using the artifact. Both the soft and hard caps increase with each season, as does the level requirement of new activities. Most activities are locked behind light level requirements, but since new players start at 750 now, this is irrelevant. There's a huge amount of activities in the game at this point so it can cater to anyone. Year one story campaigns (Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind) are somewhat lower quality compared to newer content but are a good start. There's a good amount of PvP variety if you're into that and a very large endgame with plenty of room for gear improvement.  In terms of the endgame, Destiny 2 has quite a lot. Most prominently is the raids, of which there are seven at time of writing. The three year one Leviathan raids are available to everyone, the others need the relevant DLC. The raids are long, six man activities that are heavy on interesting mechanics and both individual and team skill expression. They're all an absolute blast to play through; if you're feeling up for it, doing them completely blind and figuring everything out on your own is much more fun than looking up mechanics and encounters. Performance in Destiny is heavily based on gear, so playing through specific activities to get good perks on your armour and weapons can take some time but gives you a huge edge or can be an endgame itself if you're so inclined. There are also dungeons like the Shattered Throne, which are shorter three man raids, which can be fun to explore and challenging to play. Or maybe you want to climb in competitive PvP or PvPvE. There's even a speedrunning community if that's your style. Grabbing a bunch of friends to play through the endgame stuff is recommended, or you could find a clan that suits you or just LFG for raid groups but experiences may vary wildly.  Destiny 2 is great in its current state, the best its been in fact, but I do have some complaints, albeit somewhat minor. Transparency is one thing, with the game insisting on using vague terminology when it comes to stats, leaving the community to have to extensively test what the descriptions actually mean. It would be great if the game used numbers more to help players into deciding what gear and mods to use. Some gear farming oriented activities like the Menagerie are somewhat stingy in the amount of loot dropped for the time investment. It would be nice to have more control over activities you play, for example there is no way to launch a specific private strike, and story mission replays are on a daily rotation. Some exotics are underwhelming and not worth the slot in any way (such as Oathkeepers) and some legendaries perform better than many exotics (like the Recluse). Crucible balance is quite poor too, with Bungie reacting extremely slowly to balance it when something becomes overpowered unexpectedly. Subclass diversity is also somewhat lacking compared to D1, it would be nice to get proper skill choices and trees.  The new player experience has changed significantly with the F2P transition, with D1's intro mission being remade and added to contextualise things. New players also start at 750 light level which is good if you want to jump into endgame stuff, but kinda sucks for a sense of progression and challenge in my opinion. Year one raids are trivial at 750 light for example and the red war campaign would be a pushover. Regardless, new players have access to more than ever so I would highly recommend getting a few friends together and trying out the game. If you do, don't be afraid to ask things in local chat if you're lost or confused.",Recommended,2019.10.02,1.0

Can't say the same for other people though) -some weapon and ability metas (like stasis) can be a bit oppressive, and the nerfs that reign them in can take time -content vaulting (though I understand why they do it) just sucks to see some stuff leave",Recommended,2021.06.11,5.0

Destiny 2,kaeneuksi,"While I'm going to give this game a thumbs up because I do enjoy it, especially when playing with friends, I will say that the seasonal grind is worse than having a full time job. It is nearly impossible to reach full light level each season without dedicating an immense amount of time and effort into a game that quite honestly doesn't deserve that much time and effort. The game-play loop is excessively repetitive and 'new' content is just re-skinned re-released old content. Instead of dedicating time to even just minor improvements to make the game mildly more interesting (say, a new Gambit map, for instance, instead of just the same three or so maps each time), there is a focus on new weapons and new skins with a clear FOMO approach.  I do like the game, but I don't even bother trying to keep up anymore. I find I have the most fun if I just play casually. I don't have time for a second job.",Recommended,2022.12.28,304.6

Destiny 2,Osireis,"Destiny 2 cannot be called perfect but it also cannot be called bad. This is a game for people who like to grind and work a lot to get the loot that they want and if that doesn't appeal to you, this game isn't for you. It's a constantly evolving and changing game and that's what makes it fly high as well as sink really low. There are a few months of the year when content is really scarce and a few other times when it's almost overflowing. Needless to say, the time when there's a lot of content appeals to a lot of players but if they play only during that period of time and leave the game till the next edition of ""overflowing content time"", they will have a tough time levelling up to participate in said content. Thankfully, I have been absolutely consumed by this game and I can power through the dry parts of the year but reaching the part where I get to do a ton of new things in the game is all worth it.

Destiny 2,Gilgamesh,"DISCLAIMER: THIS INITIAL SECTION IS AN OLD REVIEW SKIP TO BOTTOM TO SEE CURRENT  This game has a lot to offer, but it struggles in quite a few big areas. It has a very diverse world with a lot to do and discover if you are new to it. However, new content seems to struggle to be engaging and a lot of power leveling and collecting becomes monotonous. The emphasis on staying up to the highest power to stay competitive in high level activities effects every player at the beginning of every season so everyone has to regrind old activities to enjoy new ones. It can burn out veteran players who don't want to regrind to be able to play content they were previously able to do. It can also be daunting for new players to catch up to the more experienced ones and seems to be a hurdle a lot of returning players come across.  The pvp is an interesting movement shooter, but some glaring issues with cheaters makes it a hard sell for high level pvp players looking to test their merit against other legit players. The lack of a visibly active and effective anti cheat makes this free-to-play game victim to many hackers and exploiters who become very apparent at the higher levels of pvp. Additionally the lack of support for the pvp sandbox can be infuriating for die-hard players. Many instances in the past have shown that weapons were far too effective and were getting far more play in pvp than anything at the time. It took months for these weapons to be adjusted and even years for the one eyed mask exotic helmet.  Overall I cant quite recommend this game to new people anymore despite the love I used to have for it. I have sunk many days of my life into this game and to see it in this state is unfortunate. I hope Bungie can turn it around but after a year and a half of hoping I have mostly given up.  EDIT: The game has changed a lot since I first wrote this review and Bungie has fixed most (if not all) of my complaints I had in my original review. The game is constantly changing and fixes have been implemented in a timely manner ever since the new engine was implemented. The world is still extremely diverse, beautiful and feels like its evolving season to season. I personally can't bring myself to grind every single weapon like I used to do, but I blame that more on my own personal fatigue rather than a gameplay flaw. I would say there isn't much a reason to not check this title out now. Enjoy exploring this diverse universe, Guardian!",Recommended,2020.08.07,4.0

Destiny 2,KiiidCannabiiis,The PVE in the game is great. There is alot to do and all can be done with friends. The graphics are top notch and the music is amazing. The PVP however is totally broken. it's unfair and unbalanced unlike anything you've ever experienced. Cheaters inhabit the Crucible like roaches in a basement.

Destiny 2,InhumanMooChu,"Destiny 2 feels amazing to play, the gun-play is top notch, the build crafting is also pretty amazing. I find myself spending many hours outside the game researching builds and weapon combos. A lot of the game's activities are accessible very early into your journey, including the most recent expansion, the final shape, which is well written, very challenging and well worth the investment.  The main downside to the game (personal opinion) is that its designed to appeal to players who want to log in daily, and a lot of the really fun and challenging activities are tied behind long, arduous grinds. Becoming high enough light level (in game recognition of your time spent) to do the best activities is ok, within reason. Destiny has an RNG based approach to gaining higher powered gear, and it can often mean spending a lot of time to earn gear which will drop in a slot you already have at that level.  I will often say to my friends this is one of the best feeling and looking games, weighed down by some design choices that really hurt new and more casual players.  From my personal experience, Destiny is an amazing game, until you get bogged down in the roots of it. Play it casually and you will come back fresh each time, enjoy your experience and be able to move on when needed. Take it too seriously and chances are you will be frustrated.",Recommended,2024.11.01,64.8

I've been playing the game for some time, and I can tell you, without a doubt, the split from Activision is amazing for Bungie, and Destiny 2.

If you wanna start playing, start on December 7th because they are making Forsaken DLC pack free (so save your money).

Destiny 2,Salit3,"Destiny is an online multiplayer (or solo) action shooter with rpg elements. You play as a superpowered guardian (3 classes) and you play different activities to level up and upgrade your gear.  Destiny is probably my favorite game franchise at this point. I've found something to enjoy in each release, started more casually but became much more interested after year 1. With Bungie's split from activision and the release of shadowkeep and new light the game is in a great spot.  For those that have never played, there is a free version of destiny called new light that includes all the year 1 content and rewards, including -The base game -The curse of osiris DLC -The warmind DLC -Year 1 strike missions -Year 1 Nightfall missions (More difficult) -Year 1 Raids (6 player pinnacle activities) -PVP modes -Gambit which combines PVP and PVE -exotic weapon quests -Secret missions like the whisper, zero hour, and bad juju which are some of my favorite levels ever -Titles and triumphs to chase -9 full planets to explore (Including the moon from shadowkeep -Year 2 activities like forges, gambit prime, and the menagerie (Although I don't think you can get year 2 loot from them) -Seasonal events like iron banner (pvp), festival of the lost (Halloween), the dawning (winter), crimson days (valentine's day), the revelry (spring), and solstice of heroes (summer)  As for year 3, they have introduced a season pass that allows a free section so if you have new light you'll still be getting year 3 content, just not as much as season pass owners.  This is an insane amount of free content. However if you end up loving the game and run out of things to chase I highly recommend the forsaken expansion which is now cheaper I believe, it includes -Forsaken campaign -2 maps (with many endgame activities) -The Last Wish Raid -A Dungeon (Harder mission) -4 new strikes (Now includes the annual pass content:) -Forges, gambit prime, reckoning, and the menagerie; with new light you can play these but I believe you need forsaken to get the rewards of which there are many) -tons of exotic quests  Shadowkeep which just released includes -Shadowkeep campaign -1 new map (The moon) -2 new strikes -The Garden of Salvation Raid -New dungeon -New finishing move emotes -Armor 2.0 update -Many quality of life updates -New pvp maps and modes -new exotic quests  Destiny has been through many ups and downs. It has some flaws to make note of. Due to the power of weapons and many exploits, overpowered weapons and abilities are nerfed or adjusted so not all weapons always feel the same. This can make pvp especially frustrating at times, but once they make adjustments it returns to normalcy. There are also microtransactions through the eververse store, but they are purely cosmetic and don't affect gameplay.  As for the positives, there is just so much to do. Experienced players often finish the newest content and run out of things to do or feel burnt out but I keep hearing stories of new players who are almost overwhelmed by all the things to do. Don't feel like you have to do everything, I'd say just have fun running through the campaigns and go from there whether you prefer pvp or pve or both. The art style and music are and always have been amazing and many of the planets are beautiful to explore.  While the destiny community can often be found complaining on reddit about weapon changes and small details, there is still a lot to love about the game and the community often rallies together to show support. Due to the multiplayer, it's easy to find players to help you. I'm sure as a destiny fanboy I'm overlooking a number of flaws, but they honestly don't bother me and I enjoy nearly everything in the game (except getting boss stomped.) I highly recommend giving it a try especially since most of it is now free. There's something for everyone and I think it's definitely worth checking out.",Recommended,2020.06.27,1.0

Destiny 2,Cherni,"After 5 years of playing this franchise, there is one thing I have learned. Bungie will mess up, and then they will show up. They know how to make a good game. Whether it be the beautiful skyboxes, the fierce battle between your fireteam and a raid boss, or the adrenaline rush when you clutch a 1v3 in the crucible, there are always amazing moments to have. Bungie's franchise is by no means perfect, but I in no way can say it isn't enjoyable. The story is unique and it shows they spent a good amount of time planning it out. The immersive experience in the base story was amazing, meeting new characters and reconnecting with old ones is amazing. We get to watch these characters develop and adapt to the troubles they face. I don't want to spoil the story for new player, so I will leave it at this, the story is something you won't want to miss. Once all of the story is out of the way, the path towards endgame begins. There is so much to chase in the world of Destiny that there is never nothing to do. It may be tedious farming for the same weapon over and over, but it is SO rewarding when you finally get that god roll weapon you have been farming hours for. You don't want to chase a weapon? Don't worry, there is so much more you can do! You and a fireteam of three could head into the Trials of Osiris, battling to reach the end to open up that chest in the lighthouse after defeating 7 other fireteams in a row. You don't like crucible? Don't worry, there is something for you too! Going into the depths of the dungeons with two other guardians, you will face difficulty straight in the face and you will come out victorious. Whether it be in the mysterious Dreaming City, or the evil caverns of the Moon. It is an experience to enjoy! The best feeling, is going into the depths of the Pit of Heresy, and coming out victorious after defeating every enemy as a . There is something for everyone. And trust me, the game may be one hell of a roller coaster sometimes, but it will always be here. If you don't enjoy the game at some point, take that break from Destiny that you think you need. The game will be here when you feel like it is worth it to play. Don't force yourself to play something you don't enjoy. Gaming is something you should look forward to. And as of right now, I look forward to playing Destiny.  Edit: The game is in an odd state, with the withdrawal of a greater majority of content it is hard. The current state of the game, mainly caused by drip-fed content, is rough. It is hard to commit my time I spend gaming to only playing destiny. I appreciate the game, as well as the devs, but it is rough when there is very low communication on where alot of the content is going to come.",Recommended,2020.05.09,3.0

Destiny 2,Grigsz,"I've been playing Destiny going on Ten Years now. I've been around since the beginning of D1 through the horrible DLCS, around for the better ones (Oryx <3). After that I was ready to pickup D2 as soon as it released. Yes, it has been long and winding and arduous with all of the changes, and content and nerfs and buffs and balancing and it really never ends. This game isn't just a game to grind though. I've made and lost countless friends, raided with people from around the world, saw the culmination of TEN YEARS of story with my best friend who I still play with to this day. Yes, you can play the numbers and make yourself the most efficient killing machine, but you can also have those moments that only games like Halo had brought previously. Hilarious deaths that should never have happened because you got WAAAYYY to carried away with a heavy grenade launcher. Rage moments because today isn't your day for PVP but your fire team is just happy you can get on to play. I've killed gods and seen warlords fall, I have traveled through countless iterations of reality in search of a fabled hero who's name was only mentioned in the fables of old. We felled the TAKEN KING, the EMPEROR OF THE CABAL EMPIRE, and the Vex keeper of TIME ITSELF and battled our way out of the clutches of THE WITCH QUEEN. I have yet to fell THE WITNESS, but it's definitely on my list. If you want an experience of forging your own story, Destiny 2 is the right game. Even if it shut down tomorrow, the experiences that I've had exploring this shared universe will be something I will be able to talk about well after it's gone with the people that shared the journey along the way.

For PVP, I wouldn't recommend it because of the current condition of neglect it is in currently.

Overall great game, one of the only games I play a lot of.",Recommended,2021.01.09,4.0
Destiny 2,Megapon,"I've played this game for a bit over 2.2k hours and I'm more inclined towards leaving a positive review than a negative one. The game has 2 major flaws, that also work as high barriers of entry:  1) This game costs a lot (too much!) to play if you want to experience all of its content. If you want to enjoy everything a destiny year has to offer, you have to pay 100 euros yearly for all of the coming seasons and dungeons etc. This doesn't go retroactively though, expansions that have come out in the past years cost far less, but still way too much for what they provide you with. 2) The new player experience is not good, they've been trying to make it better in the last period by adding new quests and such, but I still think that the game is just too confusing and grindy at the start for most people unfamiliar with the genre, or that start on their own without a friend.  There's other reasons why people dislike the game, including the past removal of content, but that practice has been deprecated, so I don't feel like kicking a dead horse.  If you manage to deal with all of these negatives, Destiny 2 can actually prove to be really good to play. The movement, gunplay, buildcrafting, synergies, weapons all feel great, the main activities; raids, dungeons, quests etc, feel amazing to play through countless times and all still provide a positively unique experience in the genre.  I recommend the game if you're ok with these main flaws I've typed above and if you're looking for a game to sink way too much time into, getting new gear and mastering 3-6 man activities.",Recommended,2023.06.04,2.0
Destiny 2,notalisk,"Fun shooter that does a good job of making you feel really awesome.  Wanna shoot a bow and feel like a god? This is the game. Wanna absolutely wreck hoards of enemies with a sword? Go for it!  You can shoot people from up close, from far away, or from in between. Like shotguns? Look no further, this game has them! Hate shotguns? Me too, they suck, so just don't use them! So many options, and you're good at all of them!!  There will be bugs and there will be times when you just can't connect, but that's okay, you can play something else until Bungie fixes it. This game is worth the wait.  Plus, it is absolutely gorgeous, and you will love wandering around and finding all the cool things. There are cute astral cats in the Dreaming City! You can pet a robo dog in the tower!  You are awesome and this game will help you feel that way even more. Enjoy!",Recommended,2023.12.28,130.8
Destiny 2,BannedByAndroid,"I got the game for free since it was still in Battle.net, but I only started on Steam when the game was officially migrated to there.  The pretty mixed reception of the series made me thought Destiny 2 would be meh. I was wrong. Like totally wrong. It's an awesome looter shooter with possibly the best gunfight experiences I have ever met in a game. Story missions are pretty intense and the multiplayer modes (especially Gambit, I loved that idea) are awesome.  It's a bit grindy, sure, but not in a bad way. This game pretty much made those grindy bits fun, and it's a good thing. With the DLCs, more interesting content can be obtained as well.  And yes, the game runs well on my system, with minimal lags and excellent optimization. Sometimes the servers are a bit fuzzy, but I have no issues most of the time while playing it.  Well done Bungie. You have made an awesome game for all and it's worth all my time.",Recommended,2019.11.18,40.8
Destiny 2,Zod,"Speaking as a player from the Battle.net days Great game to veg out and shoot alien baddies OR put on the tryhard pyjamas and get your sweat on with the crisp gunplay Bungie has goin' on. Weapon and Armor variety are pretty dope, lots of ways to drip out your character as well. Guns feel great to shoot. PvE content has a good chunk of stuff to play, even with the vaulted content, especially if you can get groups going for 6 man Raids.  Only gripes I have: - PvP has a flawed networking system behind it (I hear it's Hybrid Peer2Peer?) which can lead to a lot of frustration - Bungie does not display latency information in matches - SBMM is either non-existent or broken - You will be pitted against players with horrible internet setups from your own region and from across the world  But the times when you do get good matches -- damn are they good.

What I paid over a hundred bucks to play you can now enjoy for really nothing, and it's story is quite riveting if you are one for story, it's gun-play is impressive if you wanna jump into the Crucible and play PvP.

Destiny 2,B l u e,"Until about October 1, 2019. I've never heard of a game called Destiny (1 or 2). A friend suggested it to me and said I would probably like it. I may be late to the party, but I'm enjoying my stay.  I don't think I have been so emotionally invested in a game as Destiny 2. When I heard ""Eyes up Guardian."" for the first time, I couldn't describe how I felt in that moment. It was...new to me. I started out as a Hunter (like everyone else), played through all the campaigns (before Beyond Light), and got with my buddy and his friends to do Leviathan (my first ever raid). As of current, I am a proud Crayon Munching, Glue Sniffing Titan.  If I could describe Destiny 2 in one word, it would be Therapy. This game has helped me get through so much mess in the last 2 years. I would always log on, and whatever I was worrying about would suddenly vanish, for a while. Another thing I have heard about Destiny is that it makes you grow closer with your friends and the friends you make along the way.  Destiny 2 is not a perfect game by any means. Not by a long shot. Bugs everywhere. Honeydew here, a Beaver there. Cheaters in Trails (and in normal PvP). Sunsetting. Stasis in PVP (not as bad as it was). Bad apples in the community. List goes on and on.  Despite its flaws, I will cherish this game until the servers shut down and the memories made along the way. It has and will continue to help me see the next day and days moving forward.

Destiny 2,jspsfx,"Destiny 2 is a collection of several slightly different gameplay modes each extracting about as much diversity in experience from the core mechanics as possible.  You will quickly find there is a depth of character customization, whether practical or aesthetic, worthy of your interest and investigation. And a vast array of paths to achieve that customization. In general this game is filled with quests upon quests, menus upon submenus - goals, items and options you may not realize were available for tens of hours. Stuff to do at every turn. The game delivers a constant stream of content if you let your mouse wander.  But I must re-emphasize. All of this content is just slightly different in core experience. Over time the novelty of each mode relents and you are left with the core gameplay exposed for what it is. And in my opinion that is fun. There's nothing wrong with that. I won't pretend Destiny 2 is unique in that it's gameplay loops are all navigated by the same core mechanics. When the main hub of this game is all mentally mapped out and youve landed on each world, you will find a pretty streamlined hub for booting up whichever space marine arcade level you're in the mood for looting.  If there were anything negative I took away from this game it's that I only felt half-interested in the story. The game itself doesn't seem worried about that. Granted, there is a lot of optional lore to this game. I respect that the gameplay itself seems to take top priority. But I'm not convinced the story is anything but an obligation the developers are meeting based upon the conventions of big budget game design. To be fair, the writing itself is not poor. There may be plenty of passionate, quality writing behind the lore but it's obfuscated by the games lack of interest in telling that story to the player.  Overall this game is a lot of fun. I recommend it!",Recommended,2020.01.08,290.6

Destiny 2,501stTrooper,"Product received for free  I'm not a fan of MMORPGs, so I had my doubts about this game. After playing it for a few hours with some friends, this is a rare good version of that type of game. There's still all the annoying bits running around trying to figure out what to do, and it's really confusing for a new player since the campaign and story just kind of assumes you've been playing for all the lore drops that have happened over the past few years. So all of that is kinda weird. That being said, the core gameplay is really solid. Weapons feel great to use, the combat system is intuitive but allows for a ton of customization, and is overall a very good FPS. More fun to play with friends, and it's free so it shouldn't be too hard to get people to play with.",Recommended,2024.10.05,125.2

Destiny 2,PeterPiper-21,"I think the world that bungie has built here is amazing. The lore and a lot of the story building in this game is incredible. On top of that, the gunplay is smooth, the classes are all good in their own ways, and the pve side of this game can be amazing. However, destiny is not a pvp game. Do not go into this game thinking it is going to be a good pvp game. Pvp is full of cheaters and people who haven't seen the sun in years because they were too busy using felwinter's lie on guardians in the crucible. The pve side of things, is much better though. Destiny most definitely has had its ups and downs, and I have taken many breaks from this game throughout the years. Honestly though, this game has a special place in my steam library. Unlike other games, I still remember the first exotic I ever got, I still remember the first time I ever cleared a raid, and I still remember playing gambit for countless hours to get a bow that I only used twice, but who could forget that right? In all seriousness, play this game.

But, I was completely wrong. I enjoyed this game so much that I have 100 hours now. The grind system is good, PvP and PvE are both fun AF. I honestly don't see any flaws in this game. Yeah, there are some bugs, but I barely see them. And just the base game has quite a lot of content to explore and grind on. As for story, without giving out any spoilers, I'd say the story is decent, but short. But don't let that stop you from trying out the campaign. I honestly don't know why I didn't try this game before. So, for people who are still doubtful about trying this game out, definitely try it out.

There isn't much story content in the Destiny video games themselves, however the community has gathered a substantial amount of story from the in-game lore items.  The gameplay of Destiny 2 can't be beat; the weapons all feel satisfying to use.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Destiny 2,Razor-43,"Eyes up Guardian!  It's 2023, the game's had quite a disappointing start with Lightfall but here's to hopping the next two seasons bring it back on track. (Written at the time of Season of The Deep)  The free to play is more like a demo to show you what the game is capable of giving to you in terms of PvE, PvP and PvPvE. Its a good way to get a feel of the game before you plan on getting any DLCs. Remember this isnt the whole game and it is truly just a demo in the Free to Play they offer. DLC is recommended to have the best experience in the game   If you plan on purchasing DLC, make sure you're going to have people to experience it with and also make sure you find a clan to your liking. If you are a solo player that's also fine since there is a Destiny 2 LFG to look for people to play with should you need someone. The Latest DLC: Lightfall If you plan on purchasing it, get the annual pass along with it if you see yourself immersing into the world of destiny other wise you can get the base dlc and always update later.  Coming to the DLCs  Forsaken: You get to unlock, 1 interesting dungeon, a third ability in your arc, solar or void subclasses, an amazing Last Wish raid which drops the 1k voices Raid exotic, access to other weapons for your arsenal and more in the dreaming city.  Shadowkeep: You once again get access to more guns, 1 Hive dungeon, access to Xenophage (Exotic LMG), Divinity (Exotic Trace Rifle), Garden of Salvation Raid, a Campaign mission for the moon.  Beyond light: ICE ICE BABY, you get access to a new stasis subclass to get your foes to chill in the heat of combat, access to a wider range of weapons, Campaign on Europa, more missions regarding your stasis abilities, a new Deep Stone Crypt Raid with the chance to drop you the new Eyes of Tomorrow Exotic Rocket Launcher and much more to come.  The Witch Queen: Let me tell you right off the bat that this is one of the best campaigns since Destiny's steam release! Unlike the previous campaigns Beyond Light and Shadowkeep, this one actually gives you the campaign feel to it! You have the options to play it on a normal difficulty or a slighty harder difficulty called Legend (I recommend the latter). Apart from that you get access to a whole arsenal of new weapons, cool exotics and a new 6 player activity and new dungeons and a raid.  30th Anniversary Edition: This is more of a tiny DLC that gives you access to 1 new dungeon, 1 new 6 player activity and a small collection of good weapons. I however do not recommend getting this unless you got money to spare as the dungeon is pretty good in itself and fun to experience, and Juan the horse keeps you company in the 6 player activity. The Exotics you get are the Gjallarhorn and the Forerunner, the former one being great to use. So get this only when you've got money to spare.  The Dungeon Keys: Here's where things take a bad turn, there are two dungeon keys in the game, one for Witch Queen giving access to its 2 dungeons and one for Lightfall again giving access to its dungeons. As with the previous one only purchase them if you have extra cash lying around. This can only be bought through the ingame store with the premium currecny (Actually a really terrible idea by bungie)  WHAT DLC DO I GET? Probably get the Legendary pack which includes DLCs from Shadowkeep to Witch queen, the content in there should let you game with your friends and keep you occupied  Seasons in Destiny 2: In general every season once again gives you access to more weapons, they give you 1-3 exotics to get or chase in the season duration as well as the story driven seasonal quests. They also give you access to exclusive seasonal activities which they introduce only for that particular season.   Now if you enjoy the game on your demo you can go ahead and get all 3 in a Legendary Bundle and Lightfall if you wish, or your Friends will make you buy it. Whether you are a PvE fanatic or a PvP sharpshooter, this game has something for everyone so go ahead download it and see what it has to offer to you.",Recommended,2019.12.01,7.0

Destiny 2,Piku,"My little story about my destiny journey...  As my very first multiplayer game that also happens to be my first fps, I never thought it would be my most played game of all time with 1,764 hours. Started this game back in 2020 during Season of Dawn (S9) then became active during Season of the Worthy (S10) and the longest one, Season of Arrivals (S11), which lasted from June to November.   I've only played the most basic activities in the first few months. Then, I learned how to appreciate crucible after a little more exposure and ""training"" but even after that I know I'm not a PvP player at all haha, so I didn't do any Survival or Trials of Osiris. I did enjoy PvE more and grinded the hell out of the game during the second half of the year to experience what I have been missing out. I tried most of the raids and dungeons, all the exotics that I can get and all the gears, weapons, items, even triumphs, seals and lore. I tried getting them all before they move to the Destiny Content Vault (DCV) near the end of the year.   I experienced sherpa runs with my clan mates for Leviathan raid, Eater of Worlds, Spire of Stars, Crown of Sorrows and Scourge of the Past. All were done like very last minute! If I remember correctly, that was around October like weeks before vaulting. In the end, I completed each one of them at least once or twice. Also, I got the quest done for Acrius, Tarrabah dropped on the first run, Anarchy after six, and I also got triumphs and armours for my collection. On top of that, there was the Worldline Zero catalyst in Escalation Protocol, Mars exotic quests, triumphs and lore, Whisper Ship in Io, Zero Hour Ship and Outbreak Perfected Catalyst (this one was tough and suuuper clutch lol), Menagerie collection and triumphs, Gambit Prime and Reckoning, Forge triumphs, shaders and emblems, and N.iobe Labs and Tribute Hall! Phew, yeah I got busy. Writing all of these down makes me feel super nostalgic. All that procrastination was a fun little adventure for me and my friends.   After vaulting, I played the other raids, Garden of Salvation and Day One for the release of Vault of Glass, but I regret still not having the achievement for Last Wish. I became a seasonal player that was only present during 2021 events until I ultimately stopped playing. With Beyond Light and Witch Queen, I cannot really afford to pay for them at this time. The new content costs like a new game already so I skipped on those entirely (hopefully, just for now). I am not sure what is left for the free-to-play players to do these days but I just don't think I can invest any more effort and time in this game. I feel like the reward I get for playing a few hours is not enough so I don't have any motivation left to return and level up my guardians and get the achievement for the Grandmaster Nightfall, for example. I might not get any excitement for playing it now but in the past, I think I had such an amazing ride. It felt like I got up to the challenge of not just learning how to play this game within those few months but also of how to meet new people and to be part of a clan. It is safe to say that I experienced enough of how incredible Destiny is and I truly enjoyed it.   I will always be grateful for all the memories I made with Destiny and with my friends. I have hundreds of screenshots in my Steam and a handful of recordings streamed on YouTube. It was fun while it lasted. I still keep the game in my library.. hoping I'd hop back in any time but I don't think that will happen. Perhaps I'm being too sentimental... and sadly, I should say my farewell and uninstall soon. I will miss my Warlock and my fireteam.",Recommended,2022.03.22,1.0
Destiny 2,Big Smork,"Despite having probably one of the absolute worst new player experiences there is, Destiny 2 has an ultimately satisfying gameplay loop and a convoluted at times, but interesting story to uncover as you play through it's expansions. Bringing friends makes it much more fun of course, but the game isn't horrible as a singleplayer experience. I just wish sunset expansions were able to be played somehow as I never got to experience that content in any capacity beyond the ""Timeline"" feature, which doesn't really substitute as an actual way to experience past story content. Give it a try with the included free story content and see if it's for you or not.",Recommended,2024.11.30,80.9

There are plenty of stuff you can do solo or with friends and all the activities are full of people except the older ones, but there are plenty of LFG and discord to find people to help you. There are microtransactions, but they are ONLY cosmetics.  Overall a great game , with rich content to keep you busy for a long time.  (Edit) 1. Content Vault sucks. Stop it Bungie 2.

All I can say is... This game is beautiful is on PC! Uncapped framerate (bye 30fps console). SLI and Crossfire support. Ultra Wide Support.  Gunplay is amazing compared to console. (grr, recoil on console!!)  I have played Destiny franchise since its launch. I have over 2200 hours on Destiny 1 and over 3000 hours on Destiny 2.  I gaurantee, if you ever need help, there is people willing to gather with you to tackle that one mission you need help with-- that they also need probably.  I have met many people and it has helped me be more social in real life talking with such an amazing community over the years. This game is all about conquering the toughest obstacles with anyone willing to go that extra mile with you and I guarantee you will make a friend from this game if you ask for help whether it be from bungie's ""looking for a fireteam"" feature or a third-party LFG site. Dont be afraid. This game is definitely more enjoyable with more people to play it with.  People ask me all the time ""how are you still playing this game?""

Builds are far more customizable now and actually builds instead of pick this exotic gun that might synergize with this subclass and exotic armor. The graphics hold up really well for a 5 year old game.

Destiny 2,Wak,"Destiny is a monumental achievement for friends who want to be able to do a bunch of activities together in many different areas. From personal experience through playing this game since its release in September of 2014,  I highly recommend this game, if not for the fun times to be had within raids, crucible, and secret missions, for the beautiful worlds, music, atmosphere, and crisp gameplay. I'm not sure why, but Destiny scratches a ""shooting badass guns"" itch for me that no other game truly can.  I can't describe this game in any other way besides that it's been incredible and inspiring to me. And has made me lifelong friends and memories I'll never forget.

And on top of that the Season Pass for Year 2 brought a lot of great content (Black Armory Forges, Gambit Prime, Menagerie) as well which is included for F2P players along with all the Y1 content!  Now for Shadowkeep I've just completed the main campaign missions and it was about what I expected and was very well put together for a smaller expansion.

Destiny 2,IcebergChuck,"This game has been great. No game has been able to keep me pulled in for as long as this game has. I have played since the beta on the Xbox One in 2014, before Destiny 2 came out for the PC in 2017. It hasn't been without it's flaws, but I have yet to play a perfect game, and I've been gaming since the Atari 2600. I love the lore that is attached to this game, the art, and the fact that I feel super powerful in the game. I also prefer cooperative multiplayer to competitive. I will hop in to play PVP every now and then, but I really don't enjoy any competitive multiplayer game. I just do it to get loot drops, or to complete triumphs. I am really excited to see what they do now that they aren't bound to Activision. I have really enjoyed Shadowkeep. My only complaint has been that there's almost too much to get done in the amount of time I have to play, ha ha. I have three characters, one of each class, and I have been grinding to get everything done before the season ends. I can't recommend this game enough.  Update: While I still enjoy this game, I feel that some things are too much of a grind. I hope they can find a good balance. This season, Season of the Plunder, has been the closest I've come to putting it down for a while. Here's hoping the next season is better.",Recommended,2019.11.27,5.0

However, the endgame for new players is currently lacking, but you still get to play a good amount of time before you have to buy a DLC.  Casual activities as well as some endgame ones have a maximum of 3 players, while raids require 6 players, so having a group to play with will make your experience so much more fun, the more friends the better.

The game is just so enjoyable, especially when grinding for exotics, and quests with my friends, even when playing the game solo i still find it enjoyable because of how the game keeps me busy. Since the game is F2P now, it brings so much more people into the game, which is nice because most gamers love to play a game with a lively community right? The only downside of the F2P i find is that you might encounter hackers in pvp which might ruins your experience but worry not, the chance you get to see the hackers are quite low, this is based on my experience unless you're very unlucky.

Destiny 2,Argyel,"Don't play this game.  THIS IS A ROLLING REVIEW WITH PERIODIC UPDATES. PLEASE READ THROUGH UPDATES, AS SOME INFORMATION EARLIER IN THIS REVIEW MAY BE OUT OF DATE.  Destiny is the pinnacle looter shooter. So much of its content is available for free that it almost makes no sense to not give it a shot. Despite a rough launch, Destiny 2 has come into its own over the past two years, and it now brings the Destiny franchise to the best place it's ever been.  It's enjoyable solo, but if you really want to experience all that Destiny has to offer, you need to bring a few friends. The raids are some of the best PvE content out there in any game, let alone an FPS. Master-level activities are tough as nails, but not unfair. For new players, there's a ton of content to explore, including all 3 year-one raid activities, Gambit, all patrol zones, all Crucible playlists, all strikes, and all forge content.  When you're ready to jump into paid content, Forsaken holds some of the best story content in the franchise, as well as three more excellent raids. Some of the magic of year 2 is gone now, but the content is all still there.  Shadowkeep (and Season of the Undying) thrusts Destiny into a new era, building on the Annual Pass model of Year 2, and is expected to set up a constant feed of content for Year 3. Plenty of new weapons and loot. New, rewarding activities (Vex Offensive drops more loot than you can reasonably deal with), a new raid set in the impossibly beautiful Black Garden, and changes to the way Destiny handles high difficulty that make the most difficult activities in Destiny not only extremely challenging, but amazingly fun and rewarding. Add to that the seasonal Artifact which you can level up to unlock perks of your choosing, augmenting the way you play.  Destiny is stupid good right now. Here's hoping that the rest of Year 3 continues to make this game even better.  Update: Year 3 has not continued to make this game better. But if you're a new player, you'll have a ton to do, and won't start seeing the cracks until you've got a couple hundred hours in. My total playtime across and now Steam approaches 2000 hours, so the issues I see now are issues that you aren't likely to experience for a while, and may even be resolved by the time you hit that point.  Update 2: Season of Arrivals has been pretty great so far. New weapons are very cool, some of them are pretty strong (Falling Guillotine, even post-fix, is amazing. Legendary Dark-Drinker). It's nice to finally see long-teased story beats moving forward. Moments of Triumph has been a boon as well, making 5 of the legacy raids farmable (uncapped rewards per week), as well as guaranteeing those who clear Spire of Stars during this time the best emote in the game. My playtime has skyrocketed during this season versus the last couple seasons, and I'm looking forward to Beyond Light.  Update 3: We're now nearly halfway through Year 4, with the release of Beyond Light, Season of the Hunt, and now we're in the tail end of Season of the Chosen. Year 4 came in hot with a ton of controversial changes, including the ""vaulting"" of all Y1 and some Y2 content, the introduction of weapon and armor sunsetting, and Stasis. Almost 6 months out from the start of the Destiny Content Vault, the removal of Y1 and some Y2 content still stings, if a bit less. They're working on fleshing out the strike playlist, which lost a ton of content, but the effects are still felt in the Crucible and Gambit playlists where map variety is at an all-time low. Season of the Hunt was pretty rough, since the seasonal activity was pretty shallow, and forced players to grind out the core playlists, emphasizing the fact that a ton of content was just cleaved from the game. Trials of Osiris has now been back for an entire year, and while the loot added in Season of the Chosen is very good (Messenger with Desperado, Igneous Hammer), the game mode still has accessibility and stinginess issues, and desperately needs measures to increase the population every weekend.  On a positive note, there have been plenty of good changes to the game in Year 4. Europa is a gorgeous destination, and without a doubt the largest the franchise has ever seen. The weather system feels downright oppressive at times, and it makes the world feel a bit more authentic. Deep Stone Crypt, the raid that shipped with Beyond Light, is beautiful, fun, exciting, and probably the most accessible raid in Destiny 2. If you're going to sherpa new players into the raiding experience, start here. Select Lost Sectors have been given high-difficulty treatments, and are home to exotic slot target farming, which is wonderful. And, unlike with Year 3, FOMO has been lessened by allowing all Year 4 content to remain in the game until Year 5 begins.  Bungie have also been fairly agile in tuning Stasis, which came into the game INCREDIBLY hot. It's still not perfect, as I think the accuracy penalty while slowed needs to go, and Stasis can still win in ways that no other subclass can (one ranged Warlock melee can drop a Thundercrash to the ground like a frozen turd falling out of an airplane), but it's certainly better than the horror show it was near the launch of Beyond Light.  Since the Destiny Content Vault is not a one-way ticket to the void, we've seen a swathe of returning content from Destiny 1, updated for Destiny 2. Strikes like Will of Crota (updated with a ""new"" boss and new name for narrative reasons), Devil's Lair, and Fallen S.A.B.E.R. have returned and been updated with champions for the various Nightfall difficulties which should include them. With these strikes returned, so too has a decent chunk of the Cosmodrome, which is home to the improved new player onboarding experience. In a few months, Destiny's first-ever raid, Vault of Glass, will return, along with the promise of harder versions of raids and dungeons.  Finally, sunsetting has been sunset. A wildly controversial change, sunsetting was a system by which the game would phase out older gear over time. While it certainly had its merits, and similar systems have been successfully implemented in other MMOs, it often negated the drive to grind for powerful loot, since everything that dropped would now have an expiration date emblazoned on its stat sheet. It also left tons of gaps in weapon archetypes and elements for use in high-end content. This works in other MMOs where weapons are little more than pretty stat sticks, but Destiny weapons have quite a bit of personality and players didn't like being forced to break off relationships with their favorites. This system is gone, and while gear which has already been sunset will remain that way, no future weapons nor armor will be given a hard expiration date when they're introduced.  Once again, we're in a place where Destiny is in a pretty good spot. We'll see how the rest of Year 4 plays out.  Update 4: Witch Queen is out. Campaign (played on Legendary) is easily the best in the Destiny franchise, and possibly even in Bungie's history. Don't miss this.  Update 5: I quit this game during the year of Witch Queen. Before the disaster of Lightfall; before several other disasters that would follow suit. Bungie broke my trust for the last time with bugs and greed and laziness two years ago. Every few months some underpaid community manager will tell you about how Bungie ""needs to earn back your trust."" They don't deserve the opportunity. Again and again they betray your trust just to rub their nipples and say ""we're sorry."" Bungie is a shell of the company it used to be. Don't play this. Don't play Marathon.

Destiny 2,Coen,"Moving whole Year 1 content to F2P, especially on Steam, gave this game second life. There is plenty of activities you can do with your friends and with daily and weekly bounties there is always something to do, something to discover. Gunplay is great, skills and weapon traits provide an additional layer to building your character and looking for the way you want to play Destiny 2. Definitely worth checking!  UPDATE September 2021  Some time has passed already, sunsetting is also done and new content is landing quite often with bright future shaping on the horizon for Destiny 2. The current state of the game? From a narrative standpoint, it is superb! Really: most of the seasonal games (GaaS) should learn how to approach plot, reveals, characters, and world-shaping. The last time I had this time with seasonal content was back in the Scarlet days in Guild Wars 2. Content-wise it is a mixed bag. We are getting new activities, usually something like a horde mode with few steps each of the seasons (the seasonal arenas) and some small instances for fireteams of three. It was some time already since the new Dungeon was introduced (there are currently 3 in the game) and the new raid (Vault of Glass remake) was opened for players. The last remake of Trials (end-game PvP content) added some life to this part of the game, but there is also a downside - The BattlEye software. Still waiting on the clarification on data collection from Bungie. Adding anti-cheat and not changing tickrate (it is 10 or something) is a little sad, but the priority here was the cheaters, so maybe in the future, we can expect better PvP.

Update: 2000 hours still no women  Update: 2500 hours some women have interest but are turned away by my steam library(lesson don't show your steam library)  Update: 3000 hours my skills with the female gender have a far superior power than previous updates, feel as though i could easily get a girlfriend, but I won't even consider unless she'll play Destiny with me.  Update: 3500 hours I have started going to the gym consistently, I am seeing results and I believe the ladies are as well. Wish me luck guardians  Update: 4000 hours gym is currently poggy. I have somehow received a girlfriend. Perhaps 4000 hours is the threshold to get a guaranteed girlfriend. I will continue to give updates every 500 hours, no one will stop me from playing Destiny.  Update 5000 hours, a lot of new experiences, had broke up with two girls i dated, learned a lot, another day 1 completion, finally starting to see results from bulking, Lance Reddick just passed, best wishes guardians.

Destiny 2,Robin,"The only reason I gave it a positive feedback is because the game have potential but year after year it seems that the game is going worse. We started the year on a positive note, a new dlc with new content. The story seemed meh over all most of the stuff were reused from previous years but after the story ended it transitioned into a raid which is the main reason I play this game, the raid and its endgame content. After a few weeks a new dungeon was released and it was not really that good, as it took couple of weeks everyone was at high light level but the light level requirement for this activity was really low. Some people even did solo flawless in the first day, which is running the 3 man activity as a solo player without dying from start to end.  I bought the deluxe edition so I had also the seasons with it. As much as I was looking forward for the seasons for new content each season had less to do then the one before it. I expected the first one to be low on content as we had a lot to do with the main dlc but the second and the third lacked also content. The game turned into a bounty simulator as the main activities and the main source of xp comes mostly from them. The current season was the biggest disappointment, we got a public event and a higher level lost sector which is like a small cave with some enemies and a boss at the end as the main activities. We also got trials which sounded good on paper but with all the disconnections and cheater I had to switch on my ps4 to get a ticket done.  In conclusion I don't even know why I gave it a positive feedback maybe because I want it to successed but I am loosing home. We will see what the last season had to offer, I have really low expectation but I also had it for this one and still got disappointed. I am in the edge to abandone the game I spent most of the hours of the last few year on as this is way too much. We willl see.",Recommended,2020.04.04,4.0

Destiny 2,haku,"Pros: 1. Destiny 2 is an incredibly immersive game that will keep you engaged for hours on end. The story is rich and complex, with interesting characters and lore to discover.  2. The gameplay is top-notch, featuring a combination of first-person shooter mechanics with RPG elements. You can customize your character with a variety of weapons, gear, and abilities, making every playthrough feel unique.  3. The social aspect of the game is great. You can team up with other players from around the world to take on various missions and activities. This creates a sense of community and makes the game even more enjoyable.  4. The graphics and sound design are fantastic, with stunning environments and epic sound effects that really bring the game to life.   1. The RNG (random number generator) can be frustrating at times. It can take hours of grinding to get the loot drops you need, which can be disheartening.  2. The game can be overwhelming for new players. There's a lot to learn, and it can take some time to get the hang of everything.  3. The game can be very repetitive, especially if you're grinding for loot or completing the same activities over and over again.  4. The game is heavily focused on PvE (player vs environment) content, which may not be appealing to everyone. If you're looking for a competitive PvP (player vs player) experience, then Destiny 2 may not be the game for you.  Overall, if you're a fan of first-person shooters, RPGs, and MMOs, then I would definitely recommend giving Destiny 2 a try. It's an engaging and immersive game that will keep you hooked for hours on end. However, if you're not a fan of PvE content or don't have the patience for RNG-based loot drops, then this game may not be for you.",Recommended,2019.11.06,3.0

So I think I can honestly say that i'm super happy with how the franchise is going, and where it's slowly turning into. This is one of those games where I'll sink like 5 hours into it, and not even realize the time has gone by with friends just doing all those activities with them. Or even running into the random people in the game or LFG, and just having a blast.

Like totally wrong. It's an awesome looter shooter with possibly the best gunfight experiences I have ever met in a game. Story missions are pretty intense and the multiplayer modes (especially Gambit, I loved that idea) are awesome.  It's a bit grindy, sure, but not in a bad way. This game pretty much made those grindy bits fun, and it's a good thing. With the DLCs, more interesting content can be obtained as well.  And yes, the game runs well on my system, with minimal lags and excellent optimization. Sometimes the servers are a bit fuzzy, but I have no issues most of the time while playing it.

I appreciate the move from Battle.net to Steam and making it F2P ( cuz its a well crafted game that everyone should give a try at least)... i know many players are angry about removing the sense of progression and put you straight into the action but that was the plan i guess, Bungie. But i want to point out an issue with New Light Players is that there is no chronological order to play the game, even after returning to the game after a long time i was mindlessly doing raids and stuff for 20-30 hrs until i went to Amanda Holliday to take the Campaign i wanted to do before starting my journey into Destiny 2.  Bungie i know you're doing your best but can you please put an option at start of the campaign for every new player so that they don't mindlessly run here and there and eventually lose the interest in the game.

It is better with friends for certain, although you can do most of the stuff alone too, just not in highest Power content unless you are really experienced.  It is a shame that content is getting vaulted every now and then but it is better this way than to try updating mountains of bugs, giving the team chance to do those overhauls and fixes in more controlled space.  I may not be from D1 days or Halo days of Bungie, but I damn sure do enjoy me some content that fits for my liking personally.  2022: Vocal community is the one who does not understand what it means to make a game of this scale, which leads me to mostly ignore them because I will not be bothered by same mundane things they are bothered by for nothing.",Recommended,2021.11.25,4.0

There are also weekly quests you can do for powerful gear. There is always something to do in Destiny 2! Customization is huge in this game too with different armors and shaders, but you can only apply paid appearances to your gear and not ones earned in the game.

Hunters, the rogues, cunning, quick, and sneaky. For those that are quick on their feet. Warlocks, the mages, supportive, but also equally brutal. For those that speak with both support and damage in mind.  All 3 classes have also 3 different subclasses, Fire, Void, and Arc (Energy). They also have 2 (1 extra with Forsaken) subtrees within said subclasses.  This is the very core of Destiny 2's gunplay and combat, and Bungie has done so damn well with this.

Destiny 2,Ignissus,"I have enjoyed Destiny 2 to a certain degree, and have enjoyed the way the game works all the way up until Bungie decided to make ALL my purchased content obsolete by changing the game to Destiny 2: Beyond Light. Bungie decided to completely remove over 150 dollars worth of expansion products I purchased without my permission because of greed, more than likely. Three or Four of the planets I was enjoying were completely removed from the game once I returned to play after a long period of time. One of the features I love about Steam is the ability to come back to enjoyable titles when I am fully ready to dive back in after a long break. This theft of purchased property is way worse than pay to win. It is pay to lose the features you love. Unfortunately, I will never be returning to play a Bungie game, because it is obvious that it is all about the money and about catering only to players who play 12 hours a day, every day, on Destiny 2 exclusively.  Okay...so...that was my rant back when I was disappointed about the removal of content from Destiny 2 during Beyond Light. Months later, I have returned to the game and realized that my view of the game was very jaded by my westernized, entitlement mentality.  I am starting to see that Destiny 2 is doing something very different than most online games. I see that they are trying to give us an evolving world that changes all the time rather than remaining constant and permanently like what it would have been 5 months in between times logged into the game. At first, I was incredibly frustrated with Bungie, but then I started to remember what Bungie did for the first person shooter world. They gave us Halo.  I really do not know any person, ever, who has complained about Halo.  So, after thinking about the idea that my 150 dollars I spent on the game and its expansions were stolen from me, I am now somewhat on the optimistic side and thinking about how I contributed to the Destiny franchise by ""investing"" in the game.  Now, it is not like I hold stocks with Bungie (maybe I should), but I do believe there is some value in helping make the franchise what it is today by supporting the game.  In addition to all this, I have come to realize that there is a lot less removed from the game with the release of The Witch Queen than so many Youtubers were saying there would be. I can still access the Moon campaign if I own Shadowkeep, I can still access a huge amount of Europa and the Beyond Light campaign, and I still get to have The Witch Queen on Mars.  Guys, I know that I am in the guilty camp of criticizing one of the greatest Devs out there because I lost content, but I think we can all agree that there is something exciting about logging into a game and seeing a different world, as though we were a bear that hibernated through the winter to find the berries growing in the spring time. :)  Think about it. Imagine that you lived in the world of Destiny 2 and you decided to go MIA for a year while other Guardians were saving the galaxy. You would miss a lot of stuff too, and things would inevitably be radically different for you. You would come back from your long, lonely hiatus only to realize that you were weaker and less equipped than those who braved the hostilities of alien encounters for the past year. You would realize that your time away from battle caused you to feel a little rusty and disoriented.  I am beginning to see what Bungie is doing here, guys...  Do you prefer playing a game like World of Warcraft, in which every time you wanted to create a new human to try a different class, you had to suffer through the twilight zone of Elwynn Forest OVER and OVER and OVER again? Or do you want to play a game where quality and life and everything in the galaxy changes and evolves with the times? You decide. Let me know what you think.  Oh yeah...and did we ever really OWN Distiny 2? We are privileged to play it and take part in a Masterpiece. I think what I am sharing is legitimate, and I am begining to wonder what the gaming world would be like if ALL games grew and evolved with the times...",Recommended,2020.11.18,88.7

Destiny 2,ICantRead (Adept),"I picked up Destiny 2 at launch for the full price. I sadly came to regret my purchase because of how tedious the game appeared to become after the main campaign ended. There just was not a lot of stuff to do or loot to collect. Fast-forward to the release of Forsaken. I didn't buy it, but I saw that a lot of free content was being released for players, including the Curse of Osiris and Warmind DLCs. After playing through both of those, and the rest of the free content Bungie has been supplying to cheap players like me, I can confidently say that there is finally enough to do in this game to keep me entertained for months possibly. There are still some tedious content in the game, but there is just enough uniqueness to the gameplay loop that has kept me hooked since Forsaken came out. Again, I haven't bought that expansion yet, or Shadowkeep, at the time of me writing this review. I know I would now feel good about buying any of those two expansions in the future if it means keeping Destiny 2 alive for many more years to come. EDIT: I bought Forsaken and Shadowkeep. Forsaken is good with plenty of content and a ton more loot to grind for. Shadowkeep is just ok, and it's kinda short. All the endgame-level activities for both expansions are a lot of fun tho. EDIT: Beyond Light is an alright expansion. Couple of new things to do like a new raid and a new subclass. However, the cost of this expansion means the rest of the content in the game seems buggy. The release of Beyond Light has brought a TON of bugs to Tower, Gambit, Crucible, and Strikes. Worst of all, the remaining 2 raids, Garden of Salvation and Last Wish, are buggy as hell. Last Wish in particular has the worst bugs, impacting final phases of the final boss encounter. If there was ever a place to NOT have a bug, it would be there, yet, now there is one. I would still recommend this game as a whole, but Bungie, please fix your game.",Recommended,2019.10.02,4.0
Destiny 2,BurneyProMod,"The game is fun. The game just asks for you to point at things and shoot them with a huge variety of guns. Not Borderlands level variety, but there's enough here to keep things interesting. Microtransactions aren't too intrusive. There's a Season Pass that is fairly balanced and doesn't require days of grinding.  The UI is a cluttered mess and there's a drastic learning curve in getting started, but once you're over that initial hump, this is one of the better FPS games on Steam.",Recommended,2019.10.26,156.9

Destiny 2,Draadtrekker,"I am going to be honest, this game is not for everyone. You will spend multiple hours before you even figure out how to play this game, you will have content gated behind knowing people who play or at the very least grouping up with people you dont know, you will have bugs frequently, you will be compelled to grind to unlock or advance the plot, and you will die to veterans who have been playing since day 1. If you can get past the flaws you will find a game that can entertain you for hours. You will also find some of the most satisfying gun play and challenging pve in almost any game. This past ""season"" has been terrible but the curse and the beauty of treating games as a service is you may not have the same experience season to season. There is also talk of sunsetting guns and they are but if you are just starting it doesnt really matter to you.

It got me into shooters, its story inspired my own writing, its lore has at times made me cry, and others made me feel brave inside, its music made me recognize just how beautiful music in general could be and lead to my current love of many different types of music at large, and through this game, I met some of the best friends I have ever known, digitally or in the real world both. This game, this franchise, this story, this community, while imperfect and with many major flaws, is from the bottom of my heart, amazing, and I would recommend it to anyone with an above-average PC and some time to spend to join us and become a Guardian. It's been a long time since I started playing this game in July of 2015; it feels like a lifetime, and in some ways, it has.  Destiny changed who I was.

Destiny 2,Menphues,"My honest review of Destiny 2! Still worth it and even been on sale. Heck I like anthem too!  Thank god the game is now on Steam, where we can write honest and helpful reviews about games! This is where the game belongs and now it has finally arrived!  So I have been playing Destiny since the first one, as a preorder first night release, so that is some time!  The first one was good, it kept myself busy for a bit but overall it was not as amazing as I wanted it to be. Then a friend got the game with the expansions, as I only had the base game, we loaded into a multiplayer match and he was levelling double the speed I was, which I thought was odd, then found out if you have the expansions, you level quicker, so fine. That's a sly tactic but okay.  I then stopped playing the first one after completing it in less than a day!  Then the second one came out and I thought I'll give it a go. So I did, found it the same as the first one, just new places, better graphics and new enemies but otherwise the game played and acted the exact same, so I got bored, like all the other players which is why the player base died quickly to not much.  Then months passed, the deluxe was on sale so thought I'll dive in and give it a go. When in, I got the season pass etc etc so I had all the content at my finger tips and that changed things.  There was a lot more to do, lots of improvements and overall a more solid game than the first year of life.  The graphics are nice and decent on the game but there is a world called Dreaming City, it is one of the final worlds you unlock and that is by far the prettiest world I've seen in a game, the crystal, world, glowing etc effects are lovely and really nice looking, so they've done it right graphically.  Controls are super easy to get used too, but the PvP just takes time to master like any PvP mode.  The game itself kinda does not have any competition, there is no direct comparison to compare this too, apart from Borderlands but again, these two games are quiet different. Yes this game has gear in which you use to increase your characters power etc, but it's not to the point of Diablo aspect of gear and when you increase, it still does not feel strong. This is why: At the start of the game, it takes a while to kill enemies, you get to max rank, go back to the start area and same applies, this is due to enemies scaling to yourself at all times so power it kinda pointless in that aspect.  There are group raids which are basically dungeons, a fair amount of content with quests, raids, missions, area's, world events etc to keep you going.  This is not a pay to win game at all. You cannot buy weapons or gear from the store, it's all random drops which I find is annoying. Some items you can get from an ingame store from following a set quest or guide if you like, but they are not always good weapons in my opinion and one's I want but there is a decent amount to keep you interested.  There is a store to purchase the vehicles to get around and ships, but again purely cosmetic but still makes you stand out let's say.  The coop is the main reason for me. Alone the game is fine but I find it gets boring super quickly. It's not a bad game and there will always be something to do and go, which is fun but there are limitations like area unlocks needed from progressing through the quest, waiting for the silly random gear drops to get something you want, which would be nice to buy but then this is stepping into the pay to win area, but I am looking on the ingame store using the ingame currency which I've maxed out a lot because there is NOTHING worse purchasing, it used to be 100K and now it is 200K. You'll hit that quickly and then spend on useless stuff but there is often not much to buy within the game. Having a store we can purchase a full gear set with the ingame currency would be good, or boosts to increase power etc and pay money etc.  There is a lot absolutely stupid grinding in this game, which I do not care about because I am not hugely invested into the Destiny World. There is a fair few people who are and quiet anal about the negative approach if you say how stupid something is, but that's an opinion we are all entitled too, like this review, but not myself and with that in mind in regards to being ""invested""... The community is not the best either. I've spent hours writing in chat asking people for help or info, but they barely talk or bother to reply... That sucks with this game.  Would I recommend the game? Yes why not it is free to play on a game that is brilliant NOW, the game offers a lot of content for the money they are asking and is a good fun coop game with nothing else around like this. Which is good and hard to say no.",Recommended,2019.10.02,239.7

Destiny 2,VYRNACH GAMING,"TL;DR version: Compared to PC's first year of release, game is so much better in terms ""unrestricted content (activities,items,etc)"", activity wait times especially for multiplayer, the ""countless quality of life improvements""  Got the game as part of a GPU bundle within first year of PC release and clocked almost 200 hours on it when it was under a different launcher. Really enjoyed the campaign and general co-op but it quickly got repetitive with the very limited content which may or may not be due to me not having any DLCs. Nothing really wrong with it at all. Just that it was very lacklustre in terms of content.  2 long years later when the game came to Steam and and went F2P, tried the game again cause some friends are playing it and was really impressed with all the changes. Especially with what they improved upon. There's just so much that has changed that it's hard to list it all here. I've at my 8th day or so of replaying the game again and I've yet to explore all the areas, the changes and so on. There's so much you can do it's almost insane and this can definitely be a bad thing if you're new to the game.  It's definitely not perfect. Sadly, server, matchmaking and fragile P2P netcode (you'll get disconnect even at the slightest network instability) issues are still a thing which apparently is worst when the network is more congested now there's alot more players now. Give the game a chance regardless what you opinion is. It's free after all and you have absolutely nothing to lose. But do try to do it with a friend",Recommended,2019.11.18,209.5

Exotic weapons that can be earned from quests and randomly dropped from enemies in the form of a delightfully sounding golden ball.  Exotic armour is also available to find though i believe most is from random drops.

Destiny 2,GeneticFreak,"Have been playing the game for over 1500 hours on Battle.net, I have to say this is one of the most satisfying FPS I ever played. The gunplay is a lot of fun, with almost all different guns having unique characteristics, sounds, and perks. The RPG factor in the game is good, hardcore players will have fun tweaking and min-maxing their build and loadout for different situations to get the most out of their character and their fireteam.  The story is good enough, and the lore is deep, a lot of hidden stuff for the nerds that want to dig into it. But the real story isn't in the campaign or the side quests. The real story is the friends we made along the way.  And the raids, the raids are mechanically THE best 6 player experience for an FPS game, rivaled only by WoW or similar high tier MMORPG games. They require you to communicate, and work together, and at some point testing your friendship. Raids are not just ""go in and kill everything"" but there are puzzles to solve, things to activate differently by different people, and mechanics to do that are very hard if you don't talk to your fireteam.

The game play loop is a relatively standard RPG affair, complete bounties, strikes and raids get more loot. The environments are beautiful and there is easily tens of hours of content. I have reached the soft-limit and now am grinding bosses for superior loot. The game is running seasons (as is common with F2Ps), so there is a ""Season Pass"", which works like your normal battle pass from other games.  So all in all, a fun free game with hours of content.",Recommended,2019.11.28,3.0

I enjoyed the main story but I understand that people found it bland. The best part of the game doesn't start until you beat the story. This game is super grindy at times, but I find it hard to stop.  I somehow enjoy the long boring hours of doing the same because being rewarded by nice loot is worth the pain.

Destiny 2,replicait,"You get to play as the protagonist in a space opera rich with lore, fighting against the darkness, alongside other guardians (many of which become lasting friends). There's an endless amount of content, much of it replayable, a good grind for gear, and seasonal content that means you have new things to look forward to every few months.  PvP needs attention, but I'm not a big PvP player so can't really speak to that. A dev team that responds to the playerbase in an even-handed way - sometimes delivering nerfs or buffs that players don't necessarily want but in the end makes for a more enjoyable gaming experience.  Now that the base game is free, I can't see any reason not to jump in and try it out, my only recommendation would be to start building up some mates, join a clan, so you can enjoy the game with other people.",Recommended,2019.12.05,1.0

I can't exactly stand by what happened at the beginning (I blame Activision partly) but the strides Bungie has made since made this game 100 times better. Plus, it's free now! So why not try it?  You will be hard pressed to find such a solid MMO-like shooter. Plenty have come close, but nothing compares to the worlds Destiny 2 has created, the variety of guns and equipment, the snappy feel of the combat, and the overall atmosphere.

Destiny 2,Phosphorcracker,"It is good. The gunplay is fun, the world and enemys are diverse and challenging. It is easy to play together with a friend regardless of power level gap. The only gripe I have with it is the limitation of the progress by weeklys. Its not too bad since there are many weeklys but I still feel like there is no reason at all to artificially stump the players growth.  The dungeons and riddles are well designed and fun for the most part. The world has many places that at first sight feel unintended just to reward you with a chest or a beautiful sight that convinces you otherwise. The lore is well written and engaging if you are interested in that kind of stuff plus the characters feel alive and unique.  A neutral mention: the bigger part of the game is intended and designed for 3 players. So if you have exactly 3 friends you want to game with, this might be a problem.  If you are looking for an easy to pick up shooter to gun and run with friends this game is for you.",Recommended,2019.11.03,240.2

Destiny 2,Maximizing,"So I've been playing Destiny since Destiny 1 and always just had it as a game I could play on the back burner if I got bored. That all changed when Destiny 2 came out and I got the game on PC. Since then it has become the main game I play and I've logged over 2000 hours on the BattleNet version. I can promise you it is a completely different game on PC. I'm not just talking about the quadruple frames, FOV slider or graphics either.. the entire UI and controls feel like they're overhauled on PC. The company ""Vicarious Visions"" was hired to make the PC version of Destiny 2 and they did a fantastic job, the game is one of the best optimized on PC I've ever played for sure which is great for any console players looking to switch to PC that cant spend thousands of dollars on one, and now because Bungie recently parted from Activision, you can even bring your characters and progression over from console to PC at no cost and of course vice versa via Cross Save. Bungie going independent was one of the best things for this franchise as they have already implemented a number of changes that include the Base Game and first few DLC's being Free To Play, PC moving to Steam, Cross Save (with the hopes of cross play in the future) and the promise of an ever evolving universe with many, many more seasons and additional content on the way for years to come. As someone who plays this game everyday I urge you to just try it out, I realize the game isn't for everyone but the great thing is now that it's free to play, whats to lose? If you're bored just download it and try it out, I'll see you star side.",Recommended,2019.10.10,5.0
Destiny 2,Pingu of a Thousand Noots,"The best paid online looter shooter game just went free to play, without all the junk that usually entails.

Destiny 2,yakas,"The rather odd mixture between MMORPG and first person shooter that actually works incredibly well.  Gain light levels in an engaging world overflowing with lore and details all around. Find a Fireteam and do strikes and raids for your PVM necessities. Go to Crucible play an FPS with a huge variety of weapons. Build your character with different loadouts, and weapon mods.  I could go on for hours. This game has so much content even when playing for free, which gets you the entirety of years 1 and 2 worth of content. If you go through all the content available for free, then you might wanna consider Shadowkeep so you can keep up with the recent stuff.  Did I mention no p2w mechanics? In a F2P game?  If you're a fan of either MMORPG or FPS games, do yourself a favor and download this thing.  Welcome, Kinderguardians!",Recommended,2019.10.02,177.5

It's a top-tier RPG with weapons and abilities that feel better than most other games out there. The story is good, the locations and visuals are amazing, the community is really great, welcoming and inclusive, and the endgame is both the most accessible and the most enjoyable out of all the MMORPG games out there. Completing raids, dungeons and challenges in Destiny is still in my opinion the most fun experience in a video game ever, and the campaigns and many other anjoyable activites only add to the overall great exeprience that is playing this game, and I don't mind paying for the yearly expansion to support all the hours of fun I have playing this game again with my friends every new season, and every new expansion.",Recommended,2019.10.02,5.0

Destiny 2,Knayrus,"Started when it went free to play on Battle.net, had only ever heard of Destiny before that. Being a massive Halo fan, I thought its Bungie so definitely went in expecting something similar to Halo. Although its a shooter involving aliens, its quite different from Halo. But honestly after almost 1000 hours on this game, I've pretty much stopped playing other games solely because of this. It's honestly such a huge game with a lot of stuff to do, or as they say 'grind' for, but the work the devs have put into this game is phenomenal, from the music to the design to the gunplay, is simply one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Took me a while in the beginning to get used to the nuances of the game, its not very newb-friendly tbh, but invest a little bit of time and you'll definitely find something here that strikes your fancy.

Destiny 2,:p,"Destiny 2 is a fantastic game that offers an exciting and engaging experience for players. The combat is fast-paced and exhilarating, the character customization is extensive and allows for a lot of personalization, and the world-building is immersive and well-crafted. However, there is one MAJOR flaw in this otherwise excellent game - the lack of the color light pink. It's surprising that such an important color is not included in the game's color palette, especially since many players love to express themselves with different color schemes. Despite this issue, the game offers plenty of other customization options, and players can still create unique and personalized characters with the available colors. I wish I can say the gameplay itself is so good that it would be easy to overlook this MAJOR flaw. Overall, this action MMO is a great game that offers a lot of fun and excitement. The lack of the color light pink is VERY disappointing for me, and takes away from the overall enjoyment of the game. If you're looking for an action MMO with engaging combat, extensive character customization, and immersive world-building, this game is definitely worth checking out (if it had light pink).",Recommended,2023.03.03,18.3

If you want to sweat it out in a pvp setting? It's got it. While there's always room for improvement, the devs are constantly taking feedback and implementing it into the game and timeline. Not to mention the fact that this game has one of the most helpful communities. If you're ever unsure of something in game, how it works or where to go...

I recommend this game for people who want to be able to have fun and play with friends. You can mess with them when exploring Open World and you might be able to get a good reaction from them. If you are a PvP Sweat on games like COD, then this might even be a challenge for you. If you like PvE content and being able to explore, then you can just explore the worlds that are available for you, and each enemy you kill has a chance to drop an Engram which are basically just weapon and armor drops. Overall, I love Destiny 2 and I am VERY excited to see the next add-on that Bungie is going to make!  I now have 3654 Hours on this game... its safe to say i love it",Recommended,2020.11.27,3.0

Destiny 2,‚ãÜ‚ãÖ‚òÜ Umi ‚òÜ‚ãÖ‚ãÜ,"Pros - Good story with alot of fun and sometimes confusing elements. - ALOOOT of content. Sometimes to the extent of being to much. - Addicting if there is something you really want. - The shooting aspect of the game is really solid when it comes to both audio and visuals - Everything you can buy with in game currency is cosmetic only. So even though its a F2P, they dont rely on P2W - There are also alot of different game modes such as Gambit and Vanguard. -  Cons - You can complete the game solo but you will not be able to enjoy all the content. There are certain guns you wont be able to get and so on. - BUGS, do I have to say much more - They throw alot of content on you in the beginning and it can be really confusing. Sometimes you dont know where to start. -  Things I dont know where to put (because they are pretty personal) - The game is really grindy. If you want a certain item you might have to do things over and over again, and sometimes that includes at specific times. For me thats not really a problem but I can see people not liking that aspect of the game. - When you have created a character you cant change the look. Just something to be aware of (cus I had no idea, and now I look stupid). - To be able to play all the content that they offer you will have to buy the Forsaken and Sadowkeep expansions (I played the free version for well over 100h and i had still plenty to do so you wont run short). -  Final thoughts Destiny 2 is a really good game. Lots of content and things to explore and just like every game it has its flaws, but I would deffinatly recommend it if you like a grindy game with a good community. The only thing i would recommend tho is to get into a clan or play with friends to be able to enjoy the entire game. Have fun :)",Recommended,2020.04.08,406.8

Destiny 2,CRASH,"I've played about a thousand hours before this came to steam. make no mistake, the gameplay IS repetitive, it's all about the grind to farm the best weapons in order to create the perfect loadout to kill everything in your path in the fastest optimal time. expect weeks if not months of grind for the season's new meta weapon, either locked behind multiple quest steps or praying for the mercy of the RNG gods to bless you with a god roll. they've tried to mitigate this by adding the craft system (but you still have to grind to unlock the weapon and then level it).  Campaign is alright, you mostly just rush through it to get access to the end game content which is where the good stuff is. most of the story is hidden in the little lore tabs on items and scannables, there are gems to be found if you bother to hunt for the entries scattered across the galaxy.  PvP is fun, however there is a learning curve. matchmaking is still wonky to this day and if you don't have the meta weapons....good luck. you're dead before you can even comprehend whats happening in the 0.5 seconds TTK",Recommended,2019.12.01,4.0

I quit playing in D2Y1 because there was nothing to do, and came back when Forsaken was released, so basically all of those hours are from Y2 plus this first season of Y3.  It's good. The gunplay is amazing. It's a super cool, fun, sometimes silly, sometimes dark game. There is SO MUCH TO DO and so many things to chase -- weapons, armor, titles, lore. The PvE side is worth the investment alone. PvP is probably in the best place it's ever been in, but that's not to say it's good, quite. I have fun with it, but if you're expecting a truly competitive FPS, this ain't it, chief.  There's never been a better time to start than now. Yes, now. Yes, you. Right now. Download it and jump in.

It hits those high parts really hard and while you're on it you think to yourself, ""Yeah, this is definitely a roller coaster."" But it makes you feel queasy in all the weirdest places, and there were moments when the lighting was too much, or the voice of the guide was pretty underwhelming, and sometimes you didn't even know if the ride was stopping or just slowing down before another big fall. It's an experience you'll never have unless you put yourself out there and get in line for the testing.

Make some new freinds with a random blueberry that did a funny emote and played with you. Accomplish greatness in this game become a legend by day one raiding.

Destiny 2,Mattkill3r,"Product received for free  I started playing this game in late 2018 when it became free to play. After playing only the base game for 3 months, me and my friend decided to purchase the Forsaken expansion and it was a blast! I have made so many friends by doing raids or nightfalls (really hard strikes with crazy modifiers) with them. The game has some deep lore which can be seen in pieces anywhere, from weapons, armor, and by scanning certain objects within the world. As many people know, Destiny 2 has suffered previously from bad planning with its base game and this has caused many toxic players to leave the game in droves. This has resulted the Destiny community being one of the most friendly and helpful out of many other games.  I would advice everyone to download the Destiny app which allows you to find groups of like-minded players to do strikes, nightfalls and even raids in real time. I would advice first time players to gear up watch a tutorial video of the raid they want to do in the future. This will make raiding a more enjoyable experience for everyone.  There is so much things to do in the game now, PVE, solid PVP, and PVExPVP modes that will keep you playing for hours! You have to grind in order to receive your loot and hard work does pay off! The weapons and the feel of them are one of the best in the entire game industry. There are literally thousands of builds for you to try and test weapons and armor combinations. Have fun and don't forget to help the odd blueberry in a dungeon or quest! Keep paying the help forward.  This game has been the gateway to meeting many unique players from all around the world and personally, I run in a fireteam which is composed of some people that I really like.

Sure it has its flaws and its not for everyone but the sum of its parts makes it amazing.  Here are some of my highlights;  Minute to minute gameplay - these are the guys who made Halo so the gameplay loop is arguably the best in the business. No other game is as fun to move, shoot and punch as Destiny. Raiding - Destiny raids are the pinnacle experience for first person shooters. There is no feeling like clutch shooting Rivens eyes at the last second to save a wipe. New Direction - Bungie's expensive break from Activision, doubling down on transparency and doubling down on the core pillars of Destiny is super encouraging and makes me very excited for the future of the franchise.

Destiny 2,Krowbar Magik,"At roughly 6600 hours, it's still good.  ------------------------------------------------------- Old review from just when it came to Steam:   Pre-Steam, I had 92 Days (~2200 hours) of playtime in Destiny 2.  This review won't have any specific or technical details, but more 1 man's summary and opinions on the game.  I'll start with some more critical thoughts. Bungie doesn't always get everything right. Vanilla D2 at release left much to be desired, and plenty of things that had become common place at the end of Year 3 for D1 were suddenly gone and it felt like a step backwards. The first two content drops of D2 were also lackluster.  But there is something to be said about this game's stability, gun play, atmosphere, etc. The game feels amazing. Always has. By the time Forsaken had come out for the second year of D2, Bungie had once again found their stride like they did in D1. It took a while to find out what worked and didn't work. This is ultimately not surprising for a live service game. Forsaken improved upon so many aspects of the game that it very quickly began to feel like there was too much to do. The following annual pass for D2 also had ups and downs but they weren't as severe to the core experience of the game as they were in the first year. Honestly, most issues people had at this point were, dare I say, nit-picky.  As of now, there are so many things worth doing in this game that it would be extremely hard to even list them all.  Personally, I give this game 9 out of 9 and highly recommend.",Recommended,2019.10.02,5.0

Destiny 2,ZeroRequiem,"There's no better way in my opinion to say this other than just, try it yourself! It's free, so the only thing stopping you is your desire to give it a whirl, and the amount of time it takes to install.

I have 1,300 hours from pc back on blizz, not even including all my console time on D1 and D2. I've enjoyed this game, and stepped away when I didn't, it's as simple as that.

UPDATE:  after putting in over 150 hours of gameplay with all of shadowkeep, beyond light and forsaken, i can see the community's issues with destiny 2.  the gameplay itself: mechanics, visuals, animations, ect. are near flawless. the game is beautiful with fascinating lore and stellar sound design. however the game lacks integration. oftentimes it can feel a bit like busy-work to complete tasks that in the end do not lead to any kind of goal outside of the raids.

Destiny 2,1999 Honda Civic EK1,"Destiny is, and I believe, always will be, an absolutely fantastic franchise.  There are a million and one things that someone can get annoyed about just like almost every game. And I understand not everyone has had the experience I have (Playing since the beginning of Destiny 1), but it truly is one of the greatest games I have ever played.  You are immersed into a world that excites but at the same time keeps you on your toes. Since I started playing at the age of 12 even till now in my adulthood, this game has brought me so much joy. Obviously they've had to adapt the larger the game got and the more money they had to bring in. But I do believe they've have done quite well to retain most of the original feeling of Destiny and Destiny 2. This has all still felt like one cohesive story and play experience since I bought Destiny 2 first release.  My profile is deceptive as I have over 2,000 hours on this game if you include my time on Playstation and before Bungie migrated to Steam, and honestly this game has never upset me to the point I didn't feel like playing.  For new players today, yes there is alot to catch up on and it may be frustrating having to learn every quest and where to get what stuff but, that is the fun of it. I have always felt a rush when that grinding for a certain weapon or loot paid off. Raiding with your friends, it will never fail to bring laughs and a thrill. Crucible (PvP) is the same as almost any PVP, it will get annoying, but that's mostly not Bungie's fault.  I love this game from the bottom of my heart and am happy to keep playing it almost solely based on the joy it's brought so far. I used to jump when a thrall came at me in a cave. Now I take down giant time travelling robots.  It's immersive, it provides an incredible amount of content (some might find it short as they only play campaign missions but I assure you, find a destiny discord server or have just 5 friends to do endgame missions and you will not be disappointed with how much you can do), it brings a crazy sense of pride and thrill when you complete difficult challenges (and you are rewarded), it has real re-playablility (as you can playthrough as all 3 classes without restarting your first pick), and completionists are rewarded with really cool titles and seals that show your dedication.

Destiny 2,Siege,"A wonderfull Game, but also with a lot of flaws. The PvE Gameplay is very Fun and you can sink a lot of time into grinding. Most of the activities are very Enjoyable. Some get old and repetitive after a while, but especially the Raids (which are 6 man activities) are very nice. Some of the activities are very easy and some are very challenging. The PvP is what i dont like. Most of the encounters end with one shots from class abilitys or Ultimate Abilitis that can kill you more than once since they last so long. The current Meta is also frustating to play against. The 3 Classes you are allowed to pick are very customizable and dont get old with different skill trees and subclasses. But another big Flaw is that F2P Accounts are mostly at a disadvantage because of Weapons or Abilities that they cant obtain. This happens in both Pvp and Pve. The Storys and Dialouge are very well writen and can be either very serious or very funny. If you got a lot of Time on your Hands I can strongly recommend this Game, regardless if you want to buy the DLC or not. If you dont like Grinding one activity over and over or dont have a lot of time avilable i wouldn¬¥t play it. The Community is mostly very Fun and Helpful.

No matter what kind of player you are, whether you like PvP or PvE, being a support figure or high dps, there's a place for everyone in this game. The game itself is gorgeous, with beautiful music and stunning visuals. Destiny sucks you in, making you more curious the more you play, prompting you to try out all aspects of the game.

WHY NOBODY CARE ABOUT TEAM MATES?  why you play in team player if you arent team compatible and give a damn about your team mate? hes laying death have to wait a half minute for respawn. you could help him.

Destiny 2,Wolven,"THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN FULLY REVISED  Destiny 2 (and the franchise as a whole) is one of my favourite games, and I've poured thousands of hours into it across the two games and several platforms. While it may be a masterclass of gameplay, world-building, art and general design, the decisions Bungie has made in maintaining the health of the game and adding content to it since their split from original series publisher Activision have been...less than ideal.  I will allow that since they have become self-published, Bungie has a great deal less funding to spend on creating the larger, yearly expansions of yore, opting instead for the seasonal model of drip feeding smaller amounts of content to keep income consistent. Myself and many others have come to terms with this model being the new norm, despite how irritatingly shallow and MTX-laden it usually is. The quality of Bungie's work has fluctuated hugely when it comes to new expansions, but as of December 2021, it feels as if they're hitting their stride once again.  In the previous iteration of this review, I could not recommend the game on the basis of the overtuned Stasis subclasses thoroughly outshining all other forms of play, in both PvE and PvP content, along with complaints about general balancing and content dropping. As of the 30th Anniversary Update however, enormous balance changes to the Crucible environment, as well as a wealth of new intermediary content drops, have allowed me to genuinely enjoy playing the game for the first time in a long while. I will always have criticisms of the game, such as the abysmal experience for new players (but frankly, that's just because I care and I want the game to be the best it can be). Some folks still gripe about the particular model of expansions that Bungie uses, but it's the very same one that nearly every MMO has been using for decades. The monetisation could certainly be toned down, and more free content more frequently would go a long way to retaining players and bringing back old ones, but overall it seems to me that Bungie is closer to finding a balance between all these myriad factors.",Recommended,2021.05.24,1.0

Destiny 2,Big Mike ZF,"I played this a lot before it moved to steam, and I feel like the changes they made when they brought it over here really made a difference in the day to day grinding. Most of the game is really fun, it's got elements similar to like borderlands and halo, but is definitely its own entity. Make sure you enable local chat in the game so you can catch hints from the regulars if they see you doing something silly. And please, please please please please, look up heroic public events and how to trigger them. It's super frustrating when long time players are trying to do the simple tasks inside a public event to turn it heroic and noobs come along and nuke everything and ruin it. I.E. Taken blight event: don't kill the enemies, get the buff from going inside the blight shield, then jumping back out, and attacking the main blight. it takes a lot of damage to trigger, and if you kill all the enemies instead you just finish the event.",Recommended,2019.10.09,1.0

Yes, the game used to be trash. Not kidding. It was in such a poor state i quit for 6 months. It was awful back in 2017-18. But then Forsaken came and changed up the game quite a bit. Over the course of the last year there was a ton of content added and a lot of fun to be had. Dont let the trolls fool you, Destiny is a really fun game and Bungie is doing a lot to make their audience happy.

Destiny 2,Aido,"The Upended. A title suitable for that which turns worlds upside down. When I was still uninitiated, I would stand guard at my post. I would look to the sky and see the two suns of my Lubrae: one eternally shaded in the dark, the other always a brilliant blue. And in them, I had seen the folly of our kind. A fear of something we believed bigger than us... and a reliance on that which kept us. That blue sun that we harnessed our power from... a simple reversal of that power cracked the blue in half. Shut it off. And Lubrae... died. I did not know it at the time, but it was necessary. And now that Savath√ªn has trapped me within these walls, it will be necessary again. My Witness... whether I survive Savath√ªn's betrayal or not, the Upended will ensure we salvage our perfect goal. The final abyss... awaits us all.  ""Conqueror,"" many called me. Again and again, I heard this word. Lobbed my direction not with admiration, but with malice. ""Not a conqueror,"" I would respond. ""What, then?"" they would ask. I do not tell them, my Witness. As you so graciously taught me, I show them. Just as I did in the unholy den of those starving ""worm gods."" I'll not forget the stench of their rotting flesh... or the way they cowered as I drew near. But they soon learned I was not to be feared. In the end, I left them only a promise of sustenance, and in return, they became chattel for our greater purpose: absolute finality. And as I walked away, their fountainhead in tow, I could hear them whisper with respect: ""Subjugator.""  It was your infinite wisdom, my Witness, that led me into the planet's great sea... and face to face with that which was believed to be unbeatable. You instilled in me a true understanding of wanton domination. Not for pleasure, but as a means to achieve our absolute finality. When I reached the creature known to some as the Leviathan, it laid its thoughts bare. ""Turn from the deep, fearmonger,"" it relayed. ""I know what you seek. Press on, and you will drown in it."" ""I do not drown,"" I spoke with a defiant tongue. In a mere infinitesimal measure of time, I held a rib of this beast in one hand and pushed aside its maimed vessel with the other. ""I rise.""  Puppets, all of them. Every last Krill. Every last Hive. I once believed in a higher calling as they do. But you know that. You rescued me from that. Eternal appreciation doesn't even scratch the surface of what I owe you for the gifts you gave me. I know you hoped the Krill would see it too. We tried. We really did. But we had to let them struggle... All because of a belief that purpose had finally found them. Given them strength to conquer an oppressive homeworld. How else were they to grow? Their loss, however, is for them to grieve, not us. We will continue forward. Greater purpose awaits, my Witness.  When I stood on that precipice, watching the only world I knew collapse under its own weight... I was prepared for the splendor of abyssal eternity. But you brought me forth, my Witness. Freed me from the world that imprisoned me. Made me see the ultimate truth, one I could never see alone... That on my planet Lubrae, who I was, where I was, what I believed mattered - all amounted to absolute insignificance. I keep this mural not as some worthless sentimental reminder of what I lost, but of the opposite - of what I gained. Power. Truth of the inconsequence of most. Control over the universal strings of fate. For all this, I am eternally grateful, my Witness.",Recommended,2020.11.12,781.0

Destiny 2,goal,"I've been playing Destiny since year 1 of the first game - switched from PS4 to PC when Shadowkeep came out, and I can wholeheartedly say that this is my absolute favorite game. Through the bad time and the fantastic times, the game play continues to be top tier. If you are a new player, all the things to do might seem intimidating at first, but considering New Light is free, there is nothing to lose by giving this game a shot!  I'm incredibly PvE focused, and the raids and endgame titles continue to be a fun and involved grind. The people I've met while playing this game and being part of an incredible clan has only made the experience with this game even better. This game has helped me through some tough IRL times for sure, and even though sometimes we don't think Bungie makes the greatest decisions with this game, I'll always love it and I truly am thankful that something as amazing and expansive as this game exists.

Destiny 2,Spektrum,"Destiny 2 is an epic shooter that delivers on all fronts. The game features stunning graphics, immersive sound design, and deep lore that will keep you engaged for hours on end.  One of the standout features of Destiny 2 is its raids. These challenging missions require teamwork, coordination, and skill to complete, and offer some of the most rewarding loot in the game.  Speaking of loot, Destiny 2 is filled with it. From weapons to armor, there's always something new and exciting to find. The game's robust loot system keeps players coming back for more, and there's always a new piece of gear to chase after.  Playing with friends is where Destiny 2 truly shines. Whether you're taking on the game's toughest challenges or just exploring the game's vast world, having a group of friends to play with makes the experience even better.  However, it's worth noting that the end game can get tedious. Once you've completed all the raids and obtained some of the best gear, there's not much left to do. It can feel like a grind to keep playing, but with new content updates and events, Bungie keeps things fresh.  Overall, Destiny 2 is a fantastic game that's even better with friends. The game's raids and loot system are top-notch, but the end game can get repetitive. Nonetheless, it's a must-play for any fan of the looter shooter genre.",Recommended,2019.10.04,365.1

Destiny 2,InquisitorPikman,"I can't stop. I've been at this for years. It's an endless cycle that I have no intention of leaving.  Honestly though, this game is a blast with some major issues that are ALWAYS affecting it in some way. If you start, I would recommend bringing a friend or two, because the best content in this game is (in my opinion) the raids and dungeons, which are mainly co-op affairs. But a fair warning- if this game clicks with you, it REALLY clicks with you. No matter what grabs you, be it the tight gunplay, the beautiful art design, or some of the best lore in any game out there, there's a good chance you'll be pulled in for the long haul. That's just my two cents, so good luck to any New Lights out there, and eyes up fellow Guardians!

Destiny 2,FlosK,"Despite the bumpy road this game had on its beginning, this is a quite enjoyable masterpiece. Even though it is not revolutionary on its game mechanics per see, and has a considerably shallow gameplay loop, it is immersive enough to spend some handful of hours on. Be it just shooting at anything that moves, trying out some PvP, taking a tour over the beautiful landscapes exploring all the secret stuff, hunting pieces of lore, or just doing the campaign missions, nightfalls, or raids. The atmosphere is indiscutibly immersive Amazing soundtrack by the same composers from nothing less than Halo Gorgeous art direction and level design Incredibly satisfying gunplay And an extensive yet unobtrusive lore that is right there for anyone interested to dive in Well-timed comic relief within the dialogues Lovable and iconic characters, which they could have explored more on the main basegame campaign, but that they nailed it on the subsequent expansions, especially the Forsaken.  Easily one of my favorite games ever, even though FPS is one of the genre's I'm not very fond of.",Recommended,2019.11.07,47.5

Destiny 2,Bernd,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Destiny 2,Have A Nice Day,"Product received for free  It's a good game but it's very simple (just kill a lot of enemies that have IQ 0). Without having a dlc, you can't find strong items. (you Must to buy dlc). There are extremely duplicate steps. Does not require high skill. It's not complicated. No need for iq to complete the Mission. Overall, if you are looking to kill and fill your time this game is the right option for you. And you don't have much skill. Overall for a free game, it deserves to be played (especially with your friends).",Recommended,2019.11.27,89.5
Destiny 2,Insurgent,"Product received for free  You know at first I didn't like destiny 2, I was brought on by close friends and Whenever we played it was always just crucible or running random missions like they told me. Not knowing how to play was awful. When destiny got moved to steam I figured hell why not give it another chance? after I gave the game some time and learned it I absolutely fell in love. the pvp was revamp and is a lot more fun then when i first played it. the new quest and missions felt better. the story is fleshed out and missions are actually fun to play.  New Light. New Light showed me something. It showed me the kind of game Bungie wanted to make, the game they wanted us to play and honestly I love it. New Light bring the base destiny 2 game with War mind and curse of osiris for free. Yes free. That means all 3 of the campaigns plus all its raids, dungeons, exotics and armor 2.0 which is a complete revamp of the armor and power system in the game.  Shadowkeep is amazing. I had bought the previous destiny expansions when it was on thinking it would bring me into the game, shadowkeep did. the very first mission drops you into a combat scene with hive everywhere and you have to push them back and open up a landing zone to start taking back the moon. shadowkeep and the whole ""new light"" version of destiny hooked me and kept me. I have never had hours of fun on this game and I was able to get several of my close friends to play destiny and got them hooked as well.  Honestly the game is great and a blast to play, you will find yourself in here for hours on end doing missions playing the campaigns and enjoying all the free content that comes with New Light. I would say download it and play it, try it with friends and see for yourself how great this game is!!!  Eyes up Guardian!",Recommended,2019.11.05,1.0

Destiny 2,ÓÄòClaidÓÄò,"Edited after playing a lot of the final shape and act 1 of episode 1  Granted that the early game still has issues. Final shape seems to be turning things around for the better. Final shape will probably stay my favorite campaign in anything for a very long time. the call backs the writing is so far beyond what i expected. Witch queen had story and secrets but an over world i could care less about, which is a shame being my love of the hive. But the pale heart is so good. and fits perfectly to my tastes. prismatic is just super cool and makes me want to do builds again. the new exotics and weapons also make me want to change up my set a lot and fram. so over all the current state of destiny seems good. If you like good shooting i can suggest trying out the free version first then maybe getting dlc to spice things up as theres not too much in base destiny 2  On Last year:  The year of lightfall looked like the end of bungie and me playing destiny. But they brought it back. Unlike when New war dropped for warframe i keep wanting to play destiny and explore the venues i never did. And even when the story is wrapped up nicly with a bow and it was so good, i still want more, i wanna see where they take the game.  If i am to make suggestions. the best the game has to offer is Final shape and The Witch queen dlc's. Beyond light is not super great but is greatly improved by them changing how you aquire the stasis subclass. I personally enjoy Shadowkeep as a side area but as a dlc at full price back in the day was pretty bad. it should be loaded in with other dlc's like the 30th at this point.  I highly suggest not really getting lightfall Unless you really want strand. neomuna is the worst open space to be at, the story is pretty useless and if you wanted you could easily write it out of the game.",Recommended,2024.01.14,1.0

Destiny 2,Praedyth,"I have played Destiny almost daily since 2014, I've been through the highs and I've been through the lows. You'll know very quickly if the game is for you, there is a cathartic quality to its gameplay that few games can ever capture. You may hate the game, you may hate the loot cycle, the endgame, the servers, the hit reg, the MTX model, the content droughts, the lack of new enemy types, the meta, anything and everything, but there is a magic that keeps you coming back. Pretty soon you'll realize that maybe you don't hate things, the real reason the issues the game has bother you so much is that this game is so close to perfection, so close to the raw essence of everything an MMO FPS could be, that where it falters it draws a deeply passionate response from you. Destiny is by no means perfect, but with nearly 500 games in my Steam library alone, I still have no other game I can put on its level. Let yourself fall into it and it will be damn near lifechanging. Embrace the lore, visit the LFG sites and Discords, meet people, do the raids. This game is special, the connections you make in it will lead to real friendships, I'm going to be a groomsman in a friends wedding in a couple months, and I never would have known him if not for this game.",Recommended,2019.11.14,3.0

Wow classic had the same problem, and it was worse  now for the actual review. I have been here since the alpha and this game is close to my heart. This game is wonderful and the gunplay has yet to be beaten. Yes destiny has been in rough spots non stop. Yes the game has had some incredible depressions, but what game does not? Destiny 2 came out swinging even if the execution was poor in some areas.  Osiris and warmind were pretty decent DLC's with warmind being the better part of it since it introduced some great new stuff. Forsaken changed the game up so much. The new addition to subcalsses was great even if the balance of them was and still is somewhat messed up. Forsaken was a personal story that for anyone who played D1 felt really hard, but still enjoyable to new folk. The Dreaming City, oh MAN this place. This space is beyond beautiful and was a wild ambitious addition. No one knew what to expect but when the story started unfolding this place got nuts.  Listen, grab some friends, join a clan and make friends and just jump in. its a great game a bungie has done alot to push it forward. There is a bright future for this game and ill have its back the whole way. you really cannot go wrong with destiny 2 , especially now that the F2P version gives you ALOT.

Destiny 2,ReZoMbiE,"Astonishing visuals and highly addictive, quick-paced multiplayer experience which doesn't require long periods of uninterrupted commitment, making it perfect for those who don't have time for lengthy sessions. Also, a treasure trove for collectible hunters and completionists.  EDIT: More advanced aspects of the game, like raids and dungeons, actually DO require hours of commitment, but the player is absolutely free to neglect those activities entirely. While they are surely one of the greatest and rewarding elements of the game, they are not necessary for the in-game progression or the character leveling, as there are plenty of other, less time-consuming ways.  UPDATE: Recently introduced content vaulting has caused a lot of stress to the aforementioned collectible hunters and completionists. The massive content removal made a huge chunk of the game's collectibles no longer obtainable, and despite an early warning, there was still not enough time even for the most dedicated collectors to fill all the blanks.  FOMO WARNING: If you have OCD or otherwise are susceptible to FOMO (fear of missing out) in online games, I would suggest that you either avoid this game entirely, or be prepared to play it with an understanding that due to the time-gated nature of the game's content there will be a lot of collectibles or triumphs (in-game achievements) that you will miss. The game documents your successes (and failures) meticulously, so if you're a person who likes to tick all the boxes, you're gonna get frustrated and disappointed over missing opportunities a lot.

Destiny 2,PWNY,"This game has the potential to ensnare you with its rich lore and amazing backstory-which are not really found in the game but more in readable pieces of lore.  So, the best part of this looter is a book.  That being said, if you do fall in love with it as I have, be prepared to have the most toxic relationship with a game you've ever had. Long periods of loving it, long periods of hating it.  And I wouldn't have it any other way.",Recommended,2020.12.16,6.0
Destiny 2,FeverRot,"I must say, first and foremost, if you go in solo, expect a lonely social-less gameplay. There are discords that are active, however, if you want to participate in random group voice chats in world dungeons (USING THE IN-GAME VOICE FUNCTION) IT WON'T HAPPEN. IT. Will. Not. Happen. NO ONE uses in game voice chat. I don't know why. For me, that ruins the game, I enjoy being able to hop into games like Warhammer: Vermintide (2) and atleast have people respond OCCASIONALLY. Not the case here. People only speak in discord apparently. I've typed in chat, and that is the response I'm given. (If people even respond in chat that is)  GAMEPLAY- it's good, it's no borderlands if you're looking for diversity of guns and skills of the like, however, it does feel similar to Halo. However grindy it may be, I have not felt it impact the core gameplay. It's great if you have friends to play with, and if you don't mind an almostt single-player like experience (without using discord and finding a server with people that will let you play) it's a solid game.  I only wanted to post this review to let people know the state of the game going in without having to take extra steps, it is unfair to not mention how empty the game is if you don't go and get discord and find a server with people willing to make a party. To me, this is a deal breaker for the most part, what the hell is a multiplayer game with no player interaction?",Recommended,2019.10.09,38.4

Destiny 2,AmiSangho09,"After 5 years of playing this franchise, there is one thing I have learned. Bungie will mess up, and then they will show up. They know how to make a good game. Whether it be the beautiful skyboxes, the fierce battle between your fireteam and a raid boss, or the adrenaline rush when you clutch a 1v3 in the crucible, there are always amazing moments to have. Bungie's franchise is by no means perfect, but I in no way can say it isn't enjoyable. The story is unique and it shows they spent a good amount of time planning it out. The immersive experience in the base story was amazing, meeting new characters and reconnecting with old ones is amazing. We get to watch these characters develop and adapt to the troubles they face. I don't want to spoil the story for new player, so I will leave it at this, the story is something you won't want to miss. Once all of the story is out of the way, the path towards endgame begins. There is so much to chase in the world of Destiny that there is never nothing to do. It may be tedious farming for the same weapon over and over, but it is SO rewarding when you finally get that god roll weapon you have been farming hours for. You don't want to chase a weapon? Don't worry, there is so much more you can do! You and a fireteam of three could head into the Trials of Osiris, battling to reach the end to open up that chest in the lighthouse after defeating 7 other fireteams in a row. You don't like crucible? Don't worry, there is something for you too! Going into the depths of the dungeons with two other guardians, you will face difficulty straight in the face and you will come out victorious. Whether it be in the mysterious Dreaming City, or the evil caverns of the Moon. It is an experience to enjoy! The best feeling, is going into the depths of the Pit of Heresy, and coming out victorious after defeating every enemy as a one guardian army. There is something for everyone. And trust me, the game may be one hell of a roller coaster sometimes, but it will always be here. If you don't enjoy the game at some point, take that break from Destiny that you think you need. The game will be here when you feel like it is worth it to play. Don't force yourself to play something you don't enjoy. Gaming is something you should look forward to. And as of right now, I look forward to playing Destiny.",Recommended,2020.11.29,3.0

It seems like almost an afterthought, but they hired the best voice actors for their dialogue.  The game isn't bogged down with minigames that distract from the core loop. And the core loop is great. You're always upgrading. You always feel powerful. The weapons and classes have been intentionally balanced. No build feels completely insane. Gear score matters but skill matters more, most of the time.  Also, the Bungie network engineers are wizards. I play lag free with my friends all over the world.",Recommended,2019.10.16,178.0

Destiny 2,firegodjr,"I've played over 400 hours of this game on Blizzard before they moved to Steam.  The Good The best feeling gunfeel out of any game I've ever played. I'm not exaggerating, it's that good. It's why the game can get away with grindier quests and why I keep coming back to Destiny. It's a lot of fun. A rewarding and varied loot grind, with little fear of missing out. I've still got quests I picked up last year, and can finish them at my leisure. A story deeply intwined with lore. Hey remember when Destiny 1 came out and everyone complained that it didn't have a story? Not so anymore. Bungie has done an excellent job of pulling plot threads from many lore locations. The lore itself is huge, I highly recommend MyNameIsByf on Youtube, or ishtar-collective.net if you want to see how deep it goes. A pretty great build system. While not as deep as other looter-shooters (to keep gamemodes from being ruined by a god build), Destiny 2 provides a very nice build system that offers tons of different ways to experiment with your playstyle, especially now that Armor 2.0 is out with Shadowkeep. A dev team that cares. After sticking with this game through two rough launches, it's clear that the entire Destiny dev team is passionate about what they're making. Even more so now that Activision is out of the picture. Earnable Cosmetics. While this game does contain microtransactions, the devs have been upfront about their use to fund new content. Thanks to MTX, we got Zero Hour, a challenging race against the clock to get a new Exotic, funded entirely through Exotic weapon ornaments.     It's a good game, in my opinion. I'd recommend downloading it and trying it for yourself instead of scrolling through biased reviews. It's entirely free to play through of older content, and there's a lot of it.

I spent thousands hours in this game since D1 and I highly recommend building or joining a friend group that can just casual play the game and enjoy it for what's it's designed for. Any issues, that people complain about about the ""launch"" of the game, just disregard because it's a completely different game from what the base started with, because building a game over a period of time properly takes time.

He whispers in my ear, ""this is my server."" He grabs me with his powerful mammal hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my booty cheeks for beaver. He penetrates my pooper. It hurts so much, but I do it for beaver. I can feel my butt tearing. As my eyes start to water, I push against his force. I want to please beaver.

Destiny 2,TehCupcakes,"As far as cooperative MMOFPS games go, Destiny 2 is in a league of its own. The closest experience I can think of is Borderlands, but that is merely online multiplayer, not a true MMO. The Destiny series takes the solid gameplay style from Borderlands and adds on parties, clans, PVP matchmaking, raids, and all sorts of mechanics that MMOs are well-known for. Since it's free-to-play now, at the very least it's worth a try. The grind might get boring for some people after finishing the store, but there's still a ton of content in the story campaigns and what is there can be several hours of good fun. Definitely recommend it as a game to play with friend(s).  That being said, it also feels very flawed at times. The regular expansion releases mean that if you want to have access to all the latest content, you have to shell out a good amount of money. It's kind of equivalent to a subscription-based MMO in that regard, but you aren't obligated to pay for the new expansions if you don't want to. (On the plus side, expansion content does go free eventually, it just takes a year or two after its release.) I've heard claims that the monetization strategy is changing to focus more on seasonal cosmetics, but it remains to be seen if that will actually be a reality - I would not be surprised to see more features thrown behind a (temporary) paywall in the future.  The PvP balance can also be really off, both in terms of matchmaking and weapon equality. Power level generally doesn't mean anything, but there are usually a couple weapons which are overpowered and used repeatedly in PvP to annihilate you. I see the pvp aspects as more of a diversifier than a truly competitive experience. There players who take the competitive part seriously, and you can expect them to destroy you if you don't spend an equally ridiculous amount of time playing FPS games. The time-to-kill is so short and leaves you no opportunity to react - for me, this creates an unsatisfying competitive experience at the higher-end, although Call of Duty is popular for some reason so I guess not everyone feels the way I do.  In total, Destiny 2 has a little bit of everything and comes out as a mixed bag. Some parts I really enjoy and other parts not so much. But the beauty of the game is the freedom to choose what types of activities you want to participate in. Sure, there are rewards which are exclusive to particular activities, game modes, and raids. If you're a true collector, you will have to do a bit of everything. But that's only if you're engrossed enough in the game that you feel the need to dive deeper. There's so much content that you should have tons of hours worth of gameplay that you enjoy. It's far from a perfect game, but at the price of free it has a lot to offer. So why not give it a shot?",Recommended,2019.11.28,88.0

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I would absolutely recommend this game to any and all of my friends who are interested in first person shooter games with RPG elements.",Recommended,2019.11.05,1.0
Destiny 2,FoggyFox,"A solid looter shooter with a lot of (almost too many) things to do. In a sentence, I'd call destiny borderlands if borderlands took itself seriously and was an MMO lite. Once a player is done with the initial level grind, there are plenty of high-level activities to be done, as well as titles and weapons to chase after.  If you like PvP, then the Crucible is for you. It has casual objective-based play, free-for-all modes, competitive modes, as well as an occasional special mode: The Iron Banner. Here, ranks are earned faster, but the stakes are higher. Iron Banner also has a unique loot pool, so you'll want to hop in and get said loot before the week is up and Lord Saladin leaves the Tower to return another day.  If you like PvE more, then you can gather a few friends and hop into a Raid, a 6-person activity with unique mechanics, weapons, armour and more. These raids have several encounters that require teamwork between all 6 people to complete, and at the end you will fight an enemy that is more or less a big threat to The Last City, Earth, or even the entire system.  Maybe you like a mix of both? Enter, Gambit. Two teams of 4 battle to destroy the most enemies and bank the dark essence they drop. However, every 25 motes banked opens up a portal to the other side. This portal allows a player to invade the other side and take out the opposing team and slow them down. Banking 75 (100 in Gambit Prime) summons a primeval, a powerful interdimensional beast. The first team to kill their primeval will win. However, for every player on your team an invader kills, your primeval will heal. Gambit is a game where you don't win by being fast, you win by slowing your enemy down.  The game isn't for everyone though, and can be pretty expensive if you decide to commit to all the DLC, season passes and the like. Everything that came out in the game's first year is free to everyone however, so there isn't anything to lose by trying the game out.  If you do decide to join Destiny 2, you should keep in mind that the game is unfortunately awful at teaching new players all the mechanics and intricacies of the game's MANY systems. A guide for new players is available on Bungie's site here:  I would also recommend new players to visit the Destiny subreddit, where many resources can be found.  All in all, Destiny is a fun game with lots to do. It just requires a little learning and getting used to. Eyes up, Guardians.",Recommended,2019.11.03,1.0

The game play is one of the smoothest I have every had. Gunplay: Excellent Probably one of the best. Story: At this point and time Really good. Started rough but Bungie has really been ironing out the kinks and cleaning it up Visuals: They speak for themselves. Just Wow. The game on both PC and Console provides excellent Visual Quality. Good support for a variety of Screens. 21x9 is supported (I personaly run 21x9) Any questions feel free to comment.,Recommended,2019.10.04,1.0
Destiny 2,waloose,"This is one of the best games available. Sure, the first year of stuff (the majority of the stuff included in New Light) is a little lackluster, but it is still expertly crafted and incredibly fun. I've sunk way too much of my life into this game, having played Destiny 2 since release on Battle.net, and I don't think I'll be stopping any time soon. Come join in on the fun, it only costs you time now, and I'm sure you'll be convinced to buy the expansions once you've played for a bit.

Destiny 2,Solo,"I never played Destiny 1, but I decided to try Destiny 2 when it launched on PC and it isn't an exaggeration to say that it has changed my life.  A friend of mine invited me into a small clan, fast-forward a couple of days, and that clan exploded overnight to it's maximum capacity. The people I met, fireteamed up with, formed friendships with, are irreplaceable. This game's message, it's characters, art, the wonderful music, all has made it the longest consecutive game I've ever played. Not to mention the developers, who listen to the community and act accordingly. Their support and passion for Destiny is inspiring. The game has grown and changed so much in just two years and they say ""...this is just the beginning..."". Well I'm glad because I won't be going anywhere for awhile and I hope the game sticks around for that long too.  Destiny is made to be played with your friends, so head out into the 'verse and find some other Guardians to kick ass with. You won't regret it.",Recommended,2019.10.03,1.0
Destiny 2,Litchii,"Hello intrigued people, here's my opinion on this game.  First of all Destiny is a multiplayer game so I don't advise buying all the expansions without having experienced activities with the community or creating links with players from clans etc. So don't hesitate to go to the Destiny 2 LFG discord server to find players to learn and play with.    Without further ado, aesthetically it's a beautiful game if you have the computer to run it in ultra then give it a try, but what's really cool is that even with the graphics settings at their lowest the game still looks great and is well optimised.  In terms of content the game is well supplied however many activities are redundant the farm can be very short as well as very long.  PVE as PVP there are several levels of difficulty and you can feel a real progression when you are well surrounded you start to make a good stuff, to get good weapons, look at every little detail to min max your build, develop your game sense. If you are motivated and invested you can only progress and DAMN it's satisfying to see yourself progress and be able to do more and more complicated things! For the PVP don't expect quality, the servers are still in the Middle Ages in peer to peer, the matchmaking is often not fair. But if you are patient and persistent the gameplay Destiny 2 offers is very satisfying, for example by landing multiple headshots with a sniper or winning a duel by baiting the enemy's senses, bouncing a grenade off a wall to hit an opponent behind the cover and a lot of other cool stuff.  For the lore enjoyer: the story of this game is deep, meticulous, every little detail, every little enigma, nothing is left to chance. However, reading and following the story can be complicated as you have to collect and search for every little detail in the game. Hopefully there are databases on the web and youtubers such as:    Misc: third party websites make your experience on the game more fun, smooth and can give other objectives as well, here are some of them: , , ,  For example my favourite activity in the game by far, are raids. Here's my The website displays your record of all the raids you have done or left, they have a badge system and speedruns, completions ranking, between all players. (Worldwide ranking) Challenge seekers will be served: three man, two man or even solo raids that are normally done with 6 players. Finish them without any player dying, etc.    At the end of the day, after more than 5k hours on this game, I haven't managed to collect all triumphs, farm all godrolls of each weapons, main all characters with all subclass because Destiny is constantly evolving and that can be the biggest advantage as well as the biggest disadvantage at the same time.   I hope this has been helpful, most importantly have fun.",Recommended,2021.12.18,9.0

Destiny 2,sen,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Destiny 2,Deathwhitch,"It's free now and worth your time. May need a guide to follow the story since they haven't added a way to walk new players through the story mode before dumping you into the end game. This is a double edge sword, a pro and a con for the game.  On the one hand you can jump right in day one and play with your friends who have been in the game since launch. Basically ready to play with anyone without needing to play catch up. Only Raids and the really hardcore end game stuff need you to do some leveling first  On the other hand you have no idea how anything works or what the story is if you just jump into the end game. No tutorial or explanations are there for new players. You have to have someone tell you where to go to get to those tutorials or story content. There is an NPC in the hanger that has all that content and the game doesn't even tell you to go see her ever. you could easily never notice she was there if you weren't told about her.  TLDR: So all new players go see Amanda Holiday in the hanger (hold tab to open your map) on the tower (the games starting point) and she has all the story quest and intro stuff the game doesn't tell you about. If you dont care about story or how to play and want to jump right in with your veteran friends. You can do that too! No reason not to play!",Recommended,2019.11.30,671.4

The great gunplay, expansive deep lore, and powerful music make for a top notch experience if you can break through the horrendous new player experience. This game is best experienced with friends.

Destiny 2,Dopmeister,"Destiny 2 has drastically improved over the past 2 years, adding free to play as a great way for new players to test the waters, so don't feel like you shouldn't try this game OR give it another chance just because it was awful when you played it at launch, or heard bad things from your friends about it. End-game activities like the various raids the game has to offer are incredibly fun, gunplay has always felt amazing and snappy in this franchise, lore is intriguing to say the least and the game's various destinations are stunning. It's definitely got the potential to be more than it currently is, something Bungie hasn't always been on point with. But I keep coming back to this over and over again. If you still don't feel like spending any money on Destiny, the f2p version covers the majority of the in-game activities, you don't miss out on a lot except for some current-season stuff.",Recommended,2020.09.22,6.0

Although this is clearly a negative i definitely think that the ¬£40 is worth it and it has brought me, and continues to bring me many hundreds of hours of fun. I especially loved the campaign and ended up playing through it on all 3 of my characters which was a plus. The other main thing i enjoyed about this game was the raids.

The shooting feels good, the loot is desirable and the grind is the right balance of tedious and rewarding. You can put as much into the game as you want, and you'll almost always get that back out of the game. One thing I must stress though, is that your experience will be a million times better with friends. It's free to play, so get your friends to play. Doing things on your own is both more challenging, and less engaging. If that's your thing, then by all means go for it. But doing a raid, or coordinating a team in the Crucible is the pinnacle of what this game is.  Find some friends, play the game, and I bet you learn to like it.",Recommended,2020.06.11,4.0

Destiny 2,Professor Vex,"A quick thing I would like to say before I start, I have been playing Destiny since Beta and have always enjoyed the series, I will do my best to put any bias away and be completely honest.  So Destiny 2, it is fun game a quick summary would be follow as so, elitist raid groups, fun PvP with good gun play but low server tick rate, Free to play people are honestly locked out from what started to get this game back on its feet, and lastly, there is so much PvE content to do even without the DLC.  That is my general idea of this game and it might vary from person to person but, now that I am past that I want to go into the Pros and Cons of this game.  Cons  1. New SOLO players will have a hard time getting into the community. A way around this is very simple but can be intimidating for some. On Discord there is a Destiny 2 LFG [discordapp.com] community that has people willing to help but it can be hard to find some people for things like raids. If you have a friend or two that is new to the game then you guys can easily setup for nightfalls and raids will be similar situation just less wait time because there are more of you. and lastly if you have a friend(s) who have been playing for a while, you can learn a lot of the things you will have to from them.  2. PvP has issues and I will try my best to address all of them, one toxicity exists like most games with a competitive edge. This toxicity comes in wide range of forms from, the person is using some sort of BM emote to try and tick you off or people leaving the game because ""my team is bad""- Striker Titan with One Eyed Mask or ""Can't carry my team hard enough"" Golden Gun hunter running Celestial Nighthawk(dont do that please) or ""You guys suck, play around my rift and we win!"" Warlock with Lunafaction Boots. In all yeah it exists and it sucks.  The other thing that sucks about PVP is the low tick rate and advantage people with a high ping get. So the tick rate is rather awkward in Destiny 2 and leads to a variety of weird shots, this combined with target acquisition leads to inflated head-shot hit boxes, but to be honest this is the least of your problems.  The bigger problem goes into people with high ping, two things can happen people will get randomly disconnected and or the worst is they teleport around having free reign over the map because you can't get a direct shot on them. It sucks when you have these issues.  3. I know PVP was long but it does have a lot of issues but, we are past that now. I will now go into some more technical stuff. can you run Destiny 2 on low end computers yes to certain extent but if you are wondering that why not just look at the minimum specifications. In a much more serious tone I want to address this because I have had friends affected by it and it still happens, that is the cheat detection. Bungie's cheat detection software is Sensitive, and when you are banned it is final unless they see it as a mistake which honestly only happens from time to time. A list of programs you should avoid having open are as follows, if it puts an overlay on the game, has any sort of ""injection code"", or makes a graphical change WHILE you are in game, Virus protection software, and live background programs. Now their are certain exceptions to this and sadly I do not know the full list.  4. This game has some balance issues in both PvE and PvP, so in PvP it is more of an issue (One Eyed Mask I am looking at you even after the nerf) and other items like Thousand Voices being a raid weapon that is busted and some groups want you to have that when you might not. this one is short because a lot of games have balancing issues and I dont want to be a broken record.  5. Last thing I want to say in the cons is Eververse, this is the big problem that has existed since the beginning of Destiny 2 and has remained, luckily Eververse is not pay to win any more but still is predatory with the purchases for how much you have to pay for the cosmetics, luckily you have the power of weekly bounties that give you bright dust and let you buy certain weekly rotating cosmetic items. My thoughts on the season pass is just get deluxe you will save money in the long run compared to buying the seasons with Silver. if you aren't worried about cosmetics then you will survive, if you do, there are some free ones you can get here and there but there are not many.   1. There is a lot of content, even for new players, and buy just buying Forsaken you get one of the most expansive end games that has ever existed in Destiny. you have exotic quests raids, and with people who buy the DLC will have plenty of content and an easier time going up in light levels.  2. The good side of the community exists and is very open to teaching new players and is a lot of fun when you play with these people even after you have learned most of the things, it just leads to more funny moments of doing your first raid and finishing it. I can say personally that when I did my first raid way back I had a great time and felt amazing when I finished, so overall the good side of the community is great!  3. This is a pro for me maybe not for others but grinding in this game never truly ends, you can always get a weapon with a better roll or masterwork, there is always the Competitive Pinnacle weapon(now Ritual) there is also a Gambit and Strike ones that exist. Some items are collectible and acts as a mile stone for how long you have been playing and over all grinding for the best gear for your play style is always fun for me but, I understand not all will enjoy it.  4. There really is no one set way to play a class, while yes there is a best or most efficient way to play, but you don't have to if you want to. I personally play Nova Warp Blink with Astrocyte Verse warlock in PVP while others will go for Nezarec's Sin or something else. All that matters is you play the way you want to play and while others might say wow what are you doing, it is nice to encounter someone that says hey that is really interesting. So thinking outside the box in this game is always fun and I personally recommend it  5. The last thing I want to say is the lore, this is one of my favorite parts of this game, the lore goes so far and was put into the game while somethings from Destiny 1 were cut out such as the Exo Stranger we have been given so much lore that is in the world itself as scan items or logs you get in the triumphs, I recommend that if you want to get into it watch some channels on youtube such us who is someone I watch from time to time to try and figure something out.   So overall Destiny 2 is story about you becoming legend and pushing yourself to go beyond what you thought was possible and once you push through the early game grind you will find so many doors open up. So what I have to say is if you decide to play this game and give it a try then, eyes up guardian.",Recommended,2019.11.16,1.0

There's so much content right now, if you haven't tried, go jump in!  Edit: The Biggest concerns I have right now is the size of these seasons. It's understandable that they cannot be the size of last years seasons, but they need to have enough fresh content to keep the players engaged, and after Vex Offensive, I would recommend waiting before purchasing this season. Make sure it is worth your investment.  (Season of Chosen Edit) Yeah seasons haven't been great but this past season was fine.

Destiny 2,Sage,"It was a hot summer evening, I was up playing Overwatch really late with a couple of friends who love Destiny. I've had the notion that Destiny was a motionless grind of uneventful crap that has had a hard time with players, years before I even had the idea of trying the game. one of my friends told me to give Destiny 2 a try since the base game was free at the time and the Forsaken DLC wasn't too expensive.  I bought it.  I skipped the Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind, I jumped right into the Forsaken campaign with a couple of friends, I was instantly stunned by the immense beauty the game had. Bungie has really outdone themselves with the artwork and voice acting.  I loved the gun play, the sense of accomplishment after a week long grind for something that I knew had some uniqueness to it, I loved the complex raids and different quest steps.  There is so much I can write here but Shadowkeep is calling my name, overall; Destiny 2 has come a long way and It truly is worth trying now, especially since so much of the game is Free 2 Play. Good luck Guardians.",Recommended,2019.10.04,675.9
Destiny 2,Jedobi,"Having been playing this series since Destiny 1 on consoles and eventually owning and playing Destiny 2 since beta, i can say this is overall one the my favorite gaming series I've ever played. As far as shooters go this game does a lot right. Each weapon class feels where it belongs, there is always a meta but even so everything has its place and works. The story and setting of the destiny world is absolutely fantastic, its stunning in every way. This game offers a piece of it self to everyone, you have a very fun PvE game with tons of hours of content. From the story to the Nightfalls and Raids they are all fun. The PvP is great, the game play is always changing every season. Each class has its strong suits and weak ones but none are under powered. For me I cant find a better game to spend my time in. The community is super engaged, you can use LFG to find people to play with, the developers are actively listening to player feedback and try to create a good experience.",Recommended,2019.10.02,124.0
Destiny 2,SleepySerena,"TL;DR: The game's free, try it out for yourself. If you want people to play with, check out the Destiny 2 PC LFG Discord server, it's the largest one available. Take the game at your own pace, don't worry too much about being a top-tier player right off the bat.  -------------  Very few games match the immensely satisfying gameplay of Destiny. The gunplay is fantastic, using space magic never feels old, and doing challenging endgame content with buds is one of my favourite aspects of gaming in general. Destiny 2 is my most played game (across Steam and battlenet) because there's a lot of content, and a great (with some exceptions) community to go along with it.  I say ""with some exceptions"" because the majority of the bad eggs you'll encounter are Destiny veterans, thoroughly unsatisfied with the state of the game after 6 years. These people, most of which have been with the series since its inception in 2014, can influence newcomers' opinions before they even try the game.  I will admit that Destiny has been through a cycle of tremendous highs and dismal lows. Every fall, a big expansion comes out and it sweeps the floor, bringing in record numbers and glowing reviews. Then, 6 months later, there is a cloud of dissatisfaction and toxicity that infects discussions as the game fails to meet the fans' expectations of content.  Just know that you are stepping into a series that has had a tumultuous history. But history shouldn't change your first impression.  Destiny 2 has it all: interesting lore, a heap of loot to chase, activities for both PvE and PvP enthusiasts, a mostly helpful and passionate community, and limitless room to learn and grow as a player.

Destiny 2,Fraubo,"Like most players leaving a review I've been playing since the launch of Destiny 1 since 2014. This franchIse has seen lots of ups and downs but I can only imagine that things will just get better.  Bungie has left Activition and now they're free to make this already beatiful and filled with content game a lot better.  The free offer is hundreds of hours long for the most hardcore mmo players and still decent to good story to the more casual one with missions spanning all over the Solar System.  And if the content wasn't enough the game looks and sounds amazing. Something that you only see on AAA games which Destiny was and still is....but for FREE!

Destiny 2,metamoq,I recommend it for sure. Fun game play and nice graphics.  However! Be careful if you are transferring! Any small glitch on either your side or theirs will destroy any progress you have made with your blizzard account. I've lost everything I had and will have to start over. All the money I spent is gone. Characters are gone. They are doing nothing to fix this and their only 'fix' they recommend 'make a new steam account' doesn't work either. Good game but really terrible support for issues.  Buyer beware: If you have an issue you are SOL.

Destiny 2,[TSS] Penny,"I truly love this game from the bottom of my heart. It is my most played game of all time. it does have some serious issues: my main problem being how a lot of content is stuck behind a pay wall. but after playing this game for 4 years all I can say that every cent is worth it.  the characters are well written the music is fantastic the gameplay both ability and gun play wise are extremely satisfying and fun  the developers care about the game and the community they update us weekly on what they are working on game breaking glitches are fixed extremly quickly and community efforts like art, videos and even a fashion magazine are embraced and supported  the lore is expansive, well written and truly immersive i have cried, laughed and even been horrofied by it  yes, at the end of the season it gets a little boring but I know that at the beginning of a new season, something new is gonna come along that will remind me of how much i love it  i have a few other games like Portal 2, that cheer me up when i am at the bottom but after playing it over and over it just doesnt have that same feeling anymore, that I had when I played for the first time  destiny 2 doesnt have that  whenever something new comes along I truly feel like the very first time i booted up the game  it is grindy it is an MMO it can be frustrarting in PvP  but the genuinly caring and open minded community and the active devs really make me feel like I am part of something greater  a place where I am accepted for who I am  And only judged because I use Vex Mythoclast in PvP  if you dont have someone that is already addicted to this game to introduce you to everything it will be difficult to get the hang of it, yes  but download the free version  you can still do the main playlists a basic story mode one fantastic dungeon and my second favorite raid in the entire game  Eyes Up, Guardian",Recommended,2022.05.20,4.0

The raids are mechanically complex and perhaps the best part of the game, but they do require coordinating six people outside of the game, which can be a pain if you are not already part of a larger social gaming community.

Destiny 2,SilentCastle0,Finally Reached over 1k hours on steam but have been playing since november 2018 officially on this account but I have previous experience in d1 on my xbox 360 . overall this game is amazing but the issue with most games like this is that you need friends to have a more pleasent experience. all the content is fun. the grind for better loot in terms of weapons and armour is almost endless. this is the type of game that you will keep grinding for. dungeons are fun as they are a 3 man activity that offer good rewards and are challenging in their own way. raids are the biggest point for this game with 6 man activities that offer mechanics or puzzles that need figuring out and due to this sometimes it can be difficult if your learning how to do a raid and not many people want to play with someone like that. overall the game is amazing. you can put loads and loads of hours and still not be done with this game and that's what I find amazing about it.

Destiny 2,proemf02,"Destiny as a franchise has been a roller coaster for the past decade. I have been playing Destiny since December 2014. I was in 7th grade when I first started playing Destiny 1, and now I have just graduated college and I still play Destiny 2. This game really should have died several times over the years, but I still kept coming back even when I told myself I would drop this game for good. Between PlayStation and Steam, I have put in roughly 1,000 hours into Destiny 2, which is pretty crazy for me since I don't often put more than a dozen or so hours into any game. I hate so much about this game sometimes, which is why I tend to drop this game so often. The grindy design of many quests, a story that rarely grabs my attention, occasional performance issues, lack of enemy variety, and downright awful PVP. However, there is so much more that I like or even love about this game. The gunplay, the supers, the art design, the music, the locations, most of the characters, the weapons, the armor, the sky boxes, and the lore have always been Destiny 2's most redeeming factors in my eyes.  I believe that the Final Shape has mostly corrected those issues I mentioned while also excelling at the positives. The story was pretty good, even though parts of it didn't totally stick the landing. The ending especially feels both emotional and rushed. I loved the interactions between characters we have known and loved since D1. The art design is once again fantastic, and the music is also excellent. We finally have new enemies to fight, though we really should have seen more of them throughout the main campaign in my opinion. The Pale Heart is also a lot of fun to explore and looks beautiful. The new Prismatic subclass is also pretty fun to use and I can't wait to experiment more with it. Overall, I believe that the Final Shape is one of the best expansions Bungie has released.  If you have played Destiny 2 previously and are on the fence about buying the Final Shape, I would say go for it. Bungie, despite everything going on with them as a studio, has managed to deliver something good here. I will continue to play for a bit longer, but I'm not sure if I will be sticking around for these new episodes. It has truly been a wild ride, and I am interested to see what will happen to Destiny in the future. I have a feeling I'll be back if Bungie makes a Destiny 3.",Recommended,2024.06.15,265.4

Destiny 2,Tubby,"This game has been a wonderful addition to my day-to-day life for the past 5 years. My favorite activity to partake in is Saint-14's ""Trails of Osiris"". Not only does it give out an absolute smorgasbord of definitely not overexaggeratingly good loot, but it also manages to keep my stress levels high, sanity low, and it helps to mantain a steady rise in my blood pressure, all thanks to the ever-non-improving sandbox changes that keep the Crucible sweats and cheesers on their tippy toes. One such gameplay elevating change was made in the recent 7.1.0 update, in which they hit aggressive frame submachine guns very hard with a whopping -.8 to critical damage, and The Immortal with an even bigger smack on the nose of a 10 range reduction. These changes forever rearranged the foundations of the Crucible meta, just as hurricane Ian rearranged the housing districts on Florida's western coast.",Recommended,2023.05.28,4.0

Story, campaigns, dungeons, raids and a majority of locations are locked behind various DLCs, some more expensive than they should be.  There are however a few areas you can explore and things you can do. The gunplay is extremely good, and it also has a very high skill ceiling. Very good game to spend a little too long on, especially if you end up getting the DLCs.

Destiny 2,JIMB0,"I'd like to start this off by saying that I am THE GREATEST DESTINY TITAN known to man. I grew up in a small Texas town and ever since I was knee-high to a grasshopper my REPUBLICAN GOD fearing family always told me, 'JIMBO, you are the tower of power, too sweet to be sour.' The only response that I EVER gave them is 'Best there is past, present and future! Ohhhhh yeahhhhh!"" But don't you DARE get that mixed up with the Kool-Aid man. I am and always will be THE GREATEST there's ever been. Well wouldn't you know it but before long my nickname in high school was the Macho Man JIMBO savage and by the grace of GOD every soul in that school knew it, ""You can hang your hat on that."" I'd tell them. Let me tell you once I found Destiny, once that ghost picked me up off the ground oh yeah brother I've been a TITAN. ""Sky's the limit and space is the place!"" I'd shout as I jumped into my first ship. As I slayed and slaughtered brother it got kinda hard as time went on. I couldn't see faces and I was clinchin' tryin to hold on to memories, remember the times rollin strong. It felt like Ten thousand years had passed and I was the Intergalactic champion, oooooh yeah!

Destiny 2,SimplySupe,"UPDATED FOR THE FINAL SHAPE  Destiny 2 is a unique experience, and I often called it my favourite game that I would not recommend anyone start playing, for multiple reasons.  Its highs have been very high. Its lows, just as low. But being invested in the story and the setting, It manages to keep me on the hook and cause me to feel rewarded for my commitment. Having played since the Destiny Beta back in 2014, it feels extremely cathartic to see the narrative come full-circle with the Final Shape's campaign.  First off, one thing that NEVER disappoints are the art, sound, and music teams. Destiny has stunningly beautiful visuals and a stellar soundtrack that always captures and enhances the atmosphere of a destination or mission perfectly. I hope that this continues into the future despite the recent layoff of many creative talents at Bungie. Chief among them, Michael Salvatori, who composed some of the most iconic Destiny tracks and also co-composed the Halo soundtracks.  The Taken King, Forsaken, and Witch Queen expansions were widely considered the best content drops in Destiny for a long time and it often pains me that vanilla D2 left such a bad taste in my mouth that I never experienced Forsaken during its release. But without spoiling anything, the Final Shape has broken the standard set by its predecessors in almost every way (see my review on the Final Shape DLC page for more info).  On the subject of narrative, Content Vaulting is a concept that regrettably exists (although thankfully weapon ""sunsetting"" received enough backlash to be removed). This involves certain destinations and their related content being removed from the game and ""vaulted"" to potentially brought back later. This is a contentious issue, and rightly so. I won't try to justify paid content being removed from a game. Bungie's reasoning for this is that it allows them to load builds faster for bug fixing and tests due to the game being smaller in size. Whether you're willing to accept that or not is up to you, but a review of this game wouldn't be complete without at least mentioning it.  Seasonal content is unfortunately still subject to this arrangement. Each new expansion, the Seasons (now called ""Episodes"") are removed from the game. Although there have been strides taken to ensure content like weapons and armor are still available once the Seasons are vaulted.  Some game modes also receive more love than others, which is disheartening for the people that enjoy them (I see you, Gambit lovers). The ""Power grind"" used to be quite excruciating, and often locked you out of doing certain content entirely. However recent quality-of-life updates (such as only 1 Fireteam member needing to be above the activity's Power cap) have made content a lot less frustrating to access.  The gun-play has been and still is top notch. The new Light 3.0 sub-class re-works are brilliant and truly allow you to mix and match different play-styles in a way not seen since the original Destiny. In terms of the Dark sub-classes, Stasis has seen a re-work recently that has made it even more viable to use, and Strand has been a fantastically fun to play since its introduction in Lightfall.  The Final Shape has also introduced the new Prismatic sub-class, allowing you to combine bits and pieces from each sub-class into one. The sheer build-crafting potential with this honestly has me wide-eyed and salivating. The addition of new Exotic class items (allowing you to combine two traits from existing Exotic armors) will also boost its fun and viability.  In tandem with this, build-crafting with weapon and armour mods have had recent quality of life enhancements to make them more accessible and easily interchangeable, allowing much more variety and options for your load-outs and synergy with your sub-classes. Lightfall streamlined this system to be a lot simpler and I have honestly found it very fun to use. It definitely takes a lot less to get your head around than in previous iterations.  The new content drops have also become much more refreshing. Even with story content and destinations from Vanilla D2 up to the Forsaken campaign being vaulted, the game still has plenty of things to do, and an abundance of new activities to keep you occupied. Bungie have also made a habit of reprising previous content in their seasonal offerings, which makes the FOMO a lot less imposing.  If you're reading this and wondering ""should I come back to Destiny?"", I would tell you that the game is in the best shape (no pun intended) it's ever been. Quality-of-life improvements like in-game Loadouts, the Fireteam Finder, the new Pathfinder system (mostly replaces Bounties), account-bound Power levels, and many other changes, have made Destiny's content more accessible than ever. I would say, if any of what I just mentioned piques your interest, come and give it a try.  If you're reading this and wondering ""should I pick up Destiny and start now?"". My advice to you would be to pick the base game up for free and try out as much stuff as you can. If you like the feel and want to dive in more, then start grabbing the expansions. You can usually pick up the previous expansions on sale a lot of the time. There's also now an in-game Timeline with some playable missions to get you caught up on previous expansions and seasonal storylines.  The ""New Light"" experience has gotten a lot better, but you'll find there'll be a point where the training wheels get swiftly removed from you and you're kinda left to your own devices. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it can be jarring and turn off new players. It definitely helps to have a Destiny Veteran as a friend to guide you if possible. Otherwise, the new in-game Fireteam Finder can be helpful for finding the assistance you need.  To conclude, Destiny is a bit like a toxic relationship. When it's bad, things suck and sometimes it's best to take a break or stop playing altogether. But when it's good, it's REALLY good.  The future is always a gamble, but it's been one hell of a ride. With the Light and Darkness saga now concluded, I wait with cautious optimism to see what comes next.",Recommended,2022.03.17,2.0

The gunplay is top notch and the PC performance is incredible! Lots of content to play or grind out if that is your thing. Tons of loot, gear, hidden tasks and weekly events to keep you in the gameplay loop.  The only downside is this game isn't really meant for solo players. Can you play solo? YES, there are matchmaking features for every game type. If you are not in clan it will be hard to do raids and high tier loot content.

But just remember that after a couple of years you wont be able to play the dlcs anymore because of vaulting dlcs to make space for new ones, kind of a wierd mechanic but it saves the game from being 200 gb now and 500 gb in a couble of years  The 400 hours is in season 15 only but thats because i played the rest on my playstation, also i thought you should know that i brought the game before it was free and i dident get refund, i played since before forsaken came out and i think its a fun game.  Playing the game too much can lead you with less intent to play the game, but its still fun whenever you play it, i love grinding for stuff i really want but once i got it its fun for a week before i crave the need to grind for something new. I dont like to play crucible but its fun sometimes to watch people walk into my witherhoard and die because they want heavy ammo.  For anyone not knowing what to do, nightfall is a good way to get exotics, though it is random so you can get something you already have, remember to go get your xur exotics every week and your pinnacles to get super fast light level.

Destiny 2,Catequil,"While the game is free to play, it's more of a free to try. You get full access to at least 1 variant of each gamemode. Those are the basic PvP modes, PvE missions, but also the endgame dungeons and raids. However, you will have little to no access to seasonal content, or story content.  I highly recommend trying the game out, leveling to where you can join the free to play raids, and looking up ""Destiny 2 LFG"" on Google to find people to play with. The community is very friendly and will teach you how to do the raid. If you liked the experience, consider buying the other expansions for more raids, more story quests, and more loot.  Other notes: The gunplay is amazing thanks to the slight homing on the bullets, making shots land just slightly more often even if your aim is not perfect, leading to very forgiving yet satisfying gunplay. The guns sound good and there is a lot of unique and different guns to try out.  Exotic weapons are special weapons that have unique traits to them. One of them shoots out little spider robots that will chase and explode on enemies, there is one with an exploding laser beam, while another one is a massive minigun that grants a shield protecting the user as it fires. Each of them is unique, and can lead to unique and fun playstyles.  Progression is divided in two parts. Power level, and weapon quality. Power level is something you gain by hard work. Running specific missions each week will grant you higher power level gear. Power level only means you do more damage and have more health facing enemies at or above your power level. Enemies being under your power level does not matter. Weapon quality is mostly RNG based. Each non-exotic gun can roll with random perks and some are better than others, or suit you more than others. You will have to put in some hours to get the combination you want. But once you do, you can upgrade the power level of that weapon, meaning it will always remain a relevant tool in your arsenal.  TL;DR: Try raiding before you buy into the rest of the game. It's definitely worth it if you enjoy the raiding experience.",Recommended,2022.01.09,5.0

Destiny 2,Amsel‚Åß‚Åß‚ô°,"Honestly... Destiny 2 scratches an itch that other RPGs just don't at all. It's a good game with an extremely long grind time. PvP can be really fun and so can PvE. The D2 community is probably one of the chillest I've seen in a PvP game. They are very willing to help you out with a lot of the content (granted a lot of it is being vaulted at the time of the post or is locked behind Bungies stupid paywalls) but if you're got the time and some of the money to invest into this game I'd really suggest giving it a shot. I never really did any of the PvP content or hard PvE content cause I never had any friends to play it, but once I was able to get into the D2 community in streams. I was able to get my 1st ever flawless in Trials of Osiris and do my 1st ever Grandmaster Nightfall thanks to them. Don't think because some of the content is extremely hard that you can't do them. The community is there to help you out. Sounds like I'm promoting here but, I'd highly suggest checking out these streamers communities , Mendezszn, AngelicaFTW and maii_style) They have very welcoming communities that are willing to help out and answer questions. Even myself I'm more than happy to answer questions pertaining to D2 and to help out new light players(newbies) Sorry for the long review, I just love this game and hate this game at the same time. Mostly Bungie not giving it the love and care that it deserves and sometimes not listening to the voice of the players on the game.",Recommended,2021.11.28,2.0

Approachable for players new to loot and shoot while still having challenging endgame content for veterans.  Cons would be the expansions that are being sunset. Content that was paid for should never be completely removed.

Destiny 2,Alek,"All right. It is season 15 of Destiny 2. It has been 1474 days since Destiny 2 launched. It has been 123 days since Vault of Glass made its Destiny 2 debut. Until today, this blessed Tuesday, September 21st, 2021, I had ritually completed Vault of Glass once per character per week, across all three of my diverse characters, Warlock, Titan, and of course, Hunter, in a desperate attempt to acquire the exotic fusion rifle titled Vex Mythoclast, with my total clears count reaching an astonishing 76 runs, with 57 of them being looted clears, which is the maximum amount at the time of this review's publication. After the past 18 weeks worth of looted Vault of Glass clears, I was not much more hopeful going into this morning's weekly Tuesday reset than any other when it came to this god forsaken raid. Sure enough, my hope dwindled with each run, and after my Titan achieved my first kill on Atheon (Time's Conflux) of the week, and the mythical Mythoclast failed to drop once more on what was then my 55th looted clear, that hope only continued to diminish just as one's light fades away in zones of dark. My Warlock then glided through my 56th clear and no drop made me fear the worst just as the weeks prior had similarly done. I pressed on one final time, just as Kabr, Praedyth, and Pahanin had long ago, but as I and many Guardians have done since, we succeeded where they did not. Perhaps I exceeded this trend beyond the realm of possibility, as I pressed on as my Hunter with my final team, and we crucified the confluxes, obliterated the oracles, tormented the templar, guillotined the gorgons, gutted the gatekeepers, and utterly annihilated Atheon (Time's Conflux) once again.  Now, see just how my faith has been rewarded:   In conclusion, this was a journey. One I am not sure how to feel about, but a victory cry such as that indicates to myself that Destiny is a game that torments you, generating so much hype out of sheer anticipation and mystery that when an event at this magnitude occurs, one person can make the Earth (or I guess Venus) tremble.

Definitely worth going through the intro with a friend who already plays, or someone from the discord or something. Essentially its a great looter shooter with great buildcrafting potential and fun activities to boot, with great music and set design to murder hoards of enemies in. Investment into the lore is very well rewarded with some of the most interesting world building in sci-fi period, though without a website like ishtar collective or lore channels like mynameisbyf it's pretty easy to get lost in. Also if you find yourself liking the endgame of the free content (prophecy dungeon and Vault of glass raid) I'd definitely recommend getting witch queen.

That said, I geniunely think as of now (Beyond Light - Season of the Splicer) the game is the best it has ever been. Almost everything that was removed from the game with the launch of Beyond Light is replaced. The story is the best it has ever been and for the first time it actually feels like we are in a living world where things happen. I sunk thousands of hours in this game over two years and I don't regret it at all. It has some rough patches and definitely a lot of flaws, especially in the PvP side of things at the moment, but overall it is a fun experience. I'll especially praise the free-to-play experience this season because they released a raid -Vault of Glass- as free to play.

Destiny 2,Lirikaa,"Good day, dear friends!  Storyline - if you have not played Destiny Year one and four add-ons: The Dark Below, House of Wolves, The Taken King, Rise of lron, there is not much to say here. If you are not a fan of this game, but for some reason acquired Destiny 2, then just sit and go with a calm soul, but remember everything that you did not go through to this part, you must definitely go through. Since the plots of all parts are intertwined with different threads. I will not spoil, and tell stories, if there is no money to purchase or if you feel sorry for the video material to help you. If we compare in terms of progress, then Destiny 2, just globally significantly stepped into the perth, cut scenes and dialogues in the prologue are more and more interesting than in the entire first part.   Features of the game - against the background of complaints that in the first part, the bosses were monotonous and easy to complete, in the second part they add bosses with 2-3 stages and changing arenas. Most likely, the developers took the players' complaints as personal insults. A large number of monsters have been added to the game, with which now it will definitely not be boring. But for all the abundance of added hardcore, we are adding class abilities for more epic and exciting battles. So it is with the PvP mode for 4 people, where all your abilities increase, but this opinion may be divided. The most important thing that I forgot to say is the atmosphere, large outer spaces and various worlds. Elements of strategies where you can plan a battle, a game in which you can sit out a huge amount, Dozens of hours.  The graphics in the game are many times better, richer and more colorful. They did not save on all this stuff and with optimization, everything was done on a level and flew on a PC, with super speed. New renderings of models, locations, special effects, etc.  Conclusion - no matter how sad it is, it must be accepted as it is. The new part, as a matter of fact, has nothing new, it's just improvements, something that is not modified old, and when adding new objects, the idea cannot be called special and creative. What is captivating is of course the plot.",Recommended,2021.03.28,1.4

Destiny 2,Soul,"This game saved my life.  I am 42.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.",Recommended,2021.02.25,3.0

Destiny 2,IGotBronze,"Destiny 2 has its ups and downs, there's no sugarcoating it. However, it's been my favorite game for many years for a good number of reasons: First, the world building and lore is amazing. I really feel immersed in the world and its characters are fun. Second, the game play and the power-fantasy fulfillment are both fantastic. Bungie is well known for their gun-play and they didn't hold back when it came to Destiny 2. The game has some of the best feeling guns I've ever used, and the variety of weapons to choose from is huge. Ultimately, there's no other game quite like Destiny 2 in all of its faults and achievements and it's a game I think anyone who likes shooters should try, especially because its free. (that being said, F2P is less than ideal, and investing in the seasons and expansions is definitely something I recommend if you're enjoying the game.)",Recommended,2021.02.12,1.0

Mission design could do with some changes but overall it's a fun and good built experience. The story and lore of this universe is unmatched, you will truly get hooked if you wish to dive into what is really going on in the story. It can be super casual as well as super grindy, you can spend hours hoping for a single item you want. I would say the downsides to this game would be weapon and ability balancing. It can be awful wanting to play pvp only to lose due to a sandbox imbalance. It seems to happen frequently but patches are issued quickly for most bugs. Overall a great game, a great community that truly cares for this game. If you are thinking of buying... just do it. You'll get hooked for at least a few weeks.

Destiny 2,CrazzyC,"Original Post-BeyondLight review I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone trying to get into it now.  As a new or free to play player the game removed the vast majority of its content and two of the expansions (shadowkeep and forsaken) no longer provide weapons that are usable due to the sunsetting system. Its good that the seasons moving forward will not expire but Bungie has created the ultimate fear of missing out experience by removing the majority of the game for newer players and denied them access to the bulk of non-sunset weapons.  Post-Lightfall review Game is in a great state overall. Although it is still not particularly new player friendly or f2p, much of the content is now available through legacy bundles which are frequently on sale. New player experience is slowly getting better but still very difficult for players without help from a veteran. Sunset weapons have long been forgotten about and loot pools have been refreshed to compensate. Seasons now last an entire year allowing players to catch up on missed content and weapons. While the most recent expansion was a bit of a letdown in storytelling from last year the endgame sandbox is better than ever.",Recommended,2020.11.14,3.0

Destiny 2,JamesDC,"I was very hesitant about Destiny for years. Never played Destiny 1. The term ""Looter Shooter"" was not my forte, as I focused heavily into FPS games such as COD, Rainbow Six Siege, and more. Little did I know, I was missing out.  I tried out the free version of Destiny 2, just to get the feel of the game. After the first few campaign missions that you have to complete were done, I was then taken to the vast open world of this game.  Let me tell you, I purchased the DLC's right after, and am excited for Beyond Light to come out. I am hooked, and it's everything that I have been looking for to keep me busy for my streams, or just causal play.  My suggestion, download the free version.

Destiny 2,Ecstastic,"Beyond Light is going on the right direction again. This game is a pioneer that bridged the gap between old generation consoles to new and merged the master PC race with it. Bungie has made the base game free for all as well although it has been scrutinized for an increase of hackers ever since going free on PC. The game has become a lot less grindy and lets us enjoy other games as well. One sad thing though, they make awesome cutscenes to lure gamers into preordering but in game there is no new cutscene cinematics anymore.",Recommended,2020.10.23,3.0
Destiny 2,Retr0gr4d3,"After clocking a whopping 2000 hours on Destiny 2 (xbox) alone since the initial day of release, I can safely say that this is a game that any FPS player should have in their library. I have been playing since the first destiny's release, and can confirm that while there may be a few issues bug wise with the game, Bungie are really exceptionally good at listening to the community and fixing issues. The game regularly undergoes maintenance in order to be the very best it can be for the players, and all-in-all this game is great.  Edit: While I still recommend this game (to an extent), the past few months and seasons have shown that Bungie have taken a turn in their reliability. Not just reliability, but community care also. There was once a time where I held this company up on a pedestal (as seen above), but since then things have changed. And not for the greater. The game hasn't been in a great state for a while, and since they deleted almost half of the entire game content, it's lost the great spark it once had. When I tell you that the game was beautiful, it was. But now... Now, I don't know. As a person who's been playing the franchise since it's little brother was first conceived... I don't think the spark will ever return. I think it's all down from here.  Edit Edit: I came back. They always do. We, we always do.",Recommended,2020.10.21,2.0

Destiny 2,Coffee,"The PvE Missions, Strikes, and similar things are fun, they look great, and the gameplay feels good.  The PvP side of the game is actually terrible. Balancing takes months and that's only if the Devs feel like they should actually take a look at PvP at all. They knowingly make overpowered weapons and subclasses while leaving a bunch of things useless. Overall, their balance philosophy is a joke.  I'm very critical of the game because I love the series and hope it will do well and get better but the devs have lost their way when it comes to PvP.",Recommended,2020.09.27,2.0
