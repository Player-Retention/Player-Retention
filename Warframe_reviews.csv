Warframe,RushCit,"I hope you guys from The First Descendant, Destiny and Division read this, FAQ 1) does Warframe have raids? no Warframe doesn't have raid like Destiny does, it used to have back then but its too hectic and hard to understand so dev decide to pull it off and redesign it properly maybe in the future warframe might have raids 2) is Warframe pay to win? yes and no, you can buy your way to skip and build your equipment and upgrade your mods but in the end there's nothing to win you're only making yourself strong in shorter period of time, free to play player can get the same result just by playing earning parts and selling the parts to other player for currency, the market system in warframe is healthy its like Counter Strike with their skin market. 3) is Warframe easy? yes and no, Warframe is easy to get into but its hard to understand not to mention to master the modding system in the game, this is why even till these day people will argue about builds and how some mods work. 4) is Warframe repetitive? yes every looter shooter is repetitive my suggestion is take the game slow enjoy at your own pace leave if you want and come back when you feel like it. 5) why Warframe design is so weird? Warframe design is based on its story if you play the story you'll understand why the design is based that way. 6) how good is Warframe story? Extremely good on every update everyone wait for the story and some returnee player came back just to continue the story thats how good the story in Warframe is. 7) where bewbs and buttss? sadly Warframe isn't as sexualised as The First Descendant so for you coomer out there it might disappoint you. 8) what is that kid and guy I saw people playing in Warframe why cant I be them? I don't want to spoil you but you have to play certain quest to unlock this and there's a story behind it once you unlock it then you know why people doesn't want to spoil this. 9) why are people saying ""Just Play Warframe"" well because it is a good game unlike any other looter shooter Warframe basically popularize this genre and have been doing the right thing for almost 11 yeas and still staying strong and bringing new thing to this genre. 10) are there any PVP? sadly PVP in Warframe is dead and its awful if you're into PVP Destiny and Division does it better 11) I saw people playing Warframe in an open world environment is it an open world game? No its not only a certain area has an open world view but its not a true open world game so if you're into a true open world game this is not your cup of tea.  I've played this game before it got release on steam, I've seen ups and down changes and reversion, so if you want a game that appreciate your time Warframe is your game doesn't matter even if you left for years and return there's always community that are willing to help you re-learn, if you're disappointed by Division, Destiny, The First Descendant, give Warframe a try there's nothing to lose but your time, Warframe is so far the only game that hear what the players want and manage to kept their investor happy doing so, they wont force you to buy DLC to play new story or to progress, this is very rare thing in these day of age where most dev lock things behind a pay wall, so have a go! my comment probably wont even get read by anyone but I hope this help if anyone saw this.",Recommended,2024.07.03,2.0

Warframe,MattBatt,"Seeing as Tennocon just happened a few days ago, and has been gathering a lot interests since then, i think it would be a good idea to finally make a review on this thing. I mean i have like, what, 1500 hours on this game, so i think i qualified to talk about this game.  What is this game even Warframe is a third person PvE loot shooter, where its about collecting resources and items to craft new guns and armor so you can kill things in more ways. You play as a ""Warframe"", which are basically space ninjas. Each Warframe comes with a set of abilities to make them all special, and their mobility allows them to get across the stages with ease, and will become second nature before you know it.  Unlike most games, Warframe doesn't have a traditional progression system. All weapons and Warframes can only reach level 30, which you can easily get in a hour or two. However, your total rank (known as mastery rank) only ranks up when you level up new gear, and some items are locked behind a mastery rank. This means that it doesn't take long for new players to reach the highest level with their gear, with encouraging them to try new things as they play the game.  This is one of warframes strongest points. Pretty much all weapons and Warframe can be modded in any way you like. Wanna make your Warframe super tanky? Or maybe give his abilities alot of power for better damage? Thats all up to you. This makes the game extremely replayable, as you can experiment with different builds for your gear. You can also change the look of your items for even as a new people.  Lucky, warframe is one of the very best when it comes to this, Almost all items can be bought from the games shop, but they cost alot compared to how easy some of them are. Its as if the game says: ""Look, i get it, you dont wanna work to get that shotgun, but its gonna cost you quite a bit to buy it.."" The main you will be buying is instead things like weapon slots, warframe slots, boosters, accessories and so on. Theres also a trading system in the game, and it allows you to trade using the game's premium currency, giving the game its own economy.   Even tho i just said the game is ""extremely replayable"", this is still a loot shooter, meaning there will be grinding at times. Sometimes its not so bad, other times it goes a beyone extreme. If games with grinding doesn't suit you at all, maybe you wanna skip this one. But hey, i've over 1000 hours on the game, and im still able to enjoy the game most of the time.  So thats my short review of the game. I dont wanna go much more into details since i feel like new players should see it for themself, but this is a basic overview of what kind of game it is, and what you can expect from it. If you like what you hear, then give it a try, its free after all. Now if you will excuse me, i have some i need to get.",Recommended,2018.07.21,3.0

Warframe,Anarchist Panda,"Not pay to win Before I start my review, I want to dispell this notion. Anyone who tells you this game is pay to win is wrong, or lying to you. Most of the good weapons are mastery rank locked and even if you buy things to bypass the grind, you still have to level those Warframes and weapons, you still have to play the game to grind and get mods for your weapons and Warframes to make them actually perform well in end-game content. You're blindsiding yourself if you're going to make the argument that this game is pay to win. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get to the actual review.  Graphics I had to start off by reviewing the graphical quality of this game, because it's so beautiful. Everything is well polished and good-looking, the appearance of Warframe will not hesitate to immerse you into the environment. On top of that, graphically the game is extremely well optimized compared to other games, and can run on many older computers without an issue. There is no section of the game that is forgotten about in regards to visuals. Clearly, a lot of love has been put into this game and you can tell that immediately just by looking at how beautiful and immersive the game is.  Warframe's content and gameplay are some of the best for any free-to-play game out there. Everything in Warframe is available without paying if you are willing to grind for it. One of the best freemium models out there, seriously. You can earn Platinum, the premium currency, in-game without ever spending a cent on it. As for the Warframes themselves, each one is unique, and there are over 35 of them. 35! That's a lot of different characters to choose from. Each of them has 4 unique abilities that do different things, and you can typically mod a Warframe 3 different ways or more to focus on a specific part of their ability kit. That is a fantastic amount of customization and one of the things I love most about the game. I will say that the star chart content can get a bit repetitive at times, but if you stick it out, fill out your star chart, and get into high level content, it'll feel less repetitive in due time. At higher levels the combat gets much more complex. Try staying for at least an hour in a survival mission if you decide to play, and you'll see what I mean.  I had to talk about the cosmetics in Warframe because let's face it- fashion, looking good and uniqueness are important aspects of any videogame. Warframe has a ton of cosmetics, and they're all extremely beautiful and wonderful. Once you get through all the star chart content, you may find yourself grinding for Platinum to purchase a new set of clothes- or outright buying it with real money, I won't judge you for it. In fact, some of the best cosmetics in the game can only be purchased with real money- the TennoGen cosmetics are handsomely crafted with love by individual creators, and your money goes back to those creators, supporting them and allowing them to make more wonderful content for the game.  I'll flesh out my review by saying this. If you don't like grinding or MMO-type games, Warframe probably isn't for you. I would still give it a go even if you don't like those types of games, but you're probably not going to enjoy it if you aren't a patient person. Grinding is the name of the game in Warframe, and RNG affects many activities in the game. If you don't like the fact that you aren't guaranteed certain things and have to wait for warframes and weapons to finish building before you can use them, or that you have to farm resources to build them, then you probably won't enjoy the game. Still, if you invest your time into the grind, you can acquire nearly anything you want for no cost at all.  One great thing about Warframe is that they are constantly updating the game and delivering new content to us. Year round, we get new Warframes, quests, and content, albeit they can be buggy at the start. We received Sanctuary Onslaught, a new gamemode, and The Sacrifice, a new quest, earlier this year, and we're getting Fortuna, an open-world area on Venus later this year. That's a lot of content for one year! While it's not always the best and most optimized content, I see more love poured into Warframe content than that of any other game at the current time. The devs maintain a strong relationship with the community and actively ask questions to the players about what they want to see and what they want changed, and do frequent livestreams for fun and for discussing where they are in terms of development with the game. Their strong community commitment is one of the great things that many people love about Warframe- DE's transparency and willingness to maintain a strong bond with us is something that not many other game companies can brag about.  So, if you read my entire thing and some of my points sparked your interest, I would definitely reccommend giving the game a go. I have loved every second I've played of Warframe and I can honestly say it's one of the only games whose future updates I'm currently excited for. There are no downsides to trying the game out- after all, it's free to play and if you don't like the grind then you can stop at any time and uninstall the game. There's no paywalls or money barriers to any of the content in the game. It takes time to grind for resources and build things, but if you can develop patience, that grinding pays off, and the game will only get deeper and more complex as a result.",Recommended,2018.08.11,5.0
Warframe,Kunzer,"This is an exit-review for Warframe.  My time with Warframe spanned about 7 or 8 years. I am unfortunately at the point where I can't quite get into it anymore, which is sad but the memories I have from Warframe are super happy, to say the least.  Making the choice to try Warframe is one of the best decisions I've ever made. I made life-long friends while playing this game.  Thanks to DE for everything they've done, I always felt supported as a player here. Absolutely legendary game, so much fun to be had.

Warframe,Shard of Manus,"A lot of Warframe reviews bank on the point that it's free, and so what's the harm with trying? The answer to that is, potentially a lot. Dispense with the idea that Warframe is free - that aspect is entirely irrelevant, free or not a bad game is still bad and certainly not worth a damn.  I recommend Warframe solely because it is a good game.  Daunting, yes, Warframe is huge - as it well should be after almost six continuous years of post-release development, but that quantity upholds a consistent level of quality rivalling any other well received, well reviewed title. This game certainly demands time investment, and that aspect can put off new players that are expecting to progress at a rapid pace. You can reach a decent point in the game after some investment, but it will take thousands of hours to truly complete everything it has to offer.  As an online, instance-based, multiplayer, sci-fi action game Warframe belongs to a fairly niche market - it's most prominent rival being Destiny, and yet these two are so utterly perpendicular in their goals and aspects. Warframe is truly unique, an experience I've never encountered anywhere else, and truthfully not tailored to everyone's particular tastes.  It's big, we've touched upon that, but exactly what is it offering? Quests, progression, customisation, combat, design, music, graphics? How do these all play out in practice? Are they all great?  Short answer, no. It's hard to make a perfect game; impossible in fact, but Warframe certainly pushes some boundaries. Questing has been improving greatly over the years, and the content in the last couple has provided amazing lore and gameplay mechanics with some exceptional writing - and they seem only to be improving.  Progression and customisation tie into one overarching aspect. There's no denying that it starts off slow. Warframe is a grindy game, it makes up a large portion of the time needed to complete it, but it pays off. In a couple weeks you'll have a few frames and a bunch of weapons, in a couple of months you'll have accrued quite the varied arsenal, and within a year you'll likely have almost everything, if not all of it. Warframe doesn't tie you down or make things too hard, it just demands you put in the effort to reap the reward.  The combat of Warframe is simple, and yet incredibly complex. There could be a review on this in and of itself, so I'll make it brief - there is huge variety, and this is no mere point and click to win game (unless you're Saryn).  The design of Warframe is ever undergoing changes, to the current UI overhaul in progress, to the constant graphical improvements, to the general improvements and overhauls of map tiles and geographical spaces. The latest of which, the massive open world of Fortuna, has turned out to be and incredible display of amazing and well detailed level design.  Now, it is not without its downsides. Bugs are frequent, though ultimately the vast majority are very minor and inconsequential. It is rare to face a bug that truly causes major problems. Graphical optimisation isn't great, especially with the open world maps.  I think there must be mention of how the Market can seem unfair to new players, as it implies weapons must be bought with Platinum, but this is not the case - everything can be crafted.  Now, I will touch on the free to play aspect lastly - I've covered that this is a game and is worth your time, but I dissuade the notion one might have that it is dangerous simply because it IS free to play. Warframe Bears perhaps the most forgiving free to play scheme ever - and that is because you can obtain everything without ever paying a penny. Platinum, the premium currency, can be obtained by simply trading in-game items to players - one can accrue thousands upon thousands without ever putting money into this, and that is what is recommended.  Don't shy away because you think you'll be bottle necked into buying your way to progress, it is never the case.  Bottom line - Warframe is a great game, free or not. You should give it a go - and make friends, it's the best way to play.",Recommended,2018.11.22,2.0

DE has done a fantastic job at taking a mediocre game and transforming it into a content giant with a great community and a satisfying game loop of farming resources and building weapons and new frames. I have met many good friends and made lots of memories in Warframe. And its FREE! Thank you DE for what you have done.  Now after I have gushed, I will be real.  This game is not for everyone. If grindy games are not for you, I would reccomend you at least try Warframe, but if you get bored and leave I'd understand.  I think everyone should at least try this amazing game and experience its dedicated development team and community managers. I give Warframe a near perfect as far as games go.

Warframe,aerie,"So like... Long overdue re-review?  3008 hours ingame, 1637 hours spent in missions, and reached MR30 (which is this thing which might prevent you from getting those cool guns you've seen other people use but also is pretty much just for showing off that you've played a lot of the game and used just about every weapon or item in the game).  Let's overgeneralize a bit-  Game has big guns that go pew pew or brrap brrap or psssssssssssshhhh that kill enemies to varying degrees. Also has tons of playable characters (Warframes) that have special magic powers like going invisible or... throwing stars which you can already equip normally. (I like Zephyr. Zephyr birb.) Tons of collectible guns and such with not-so-much space to store them, but it's a pretty nice shooty shooty bang bang game for people who enjoy things like Destiny 2, Borderlands uniques, or the mindless grind of Minecraft. But there's similar things in other reviews and you can prob just Google the game itself to learn more about the amazing timesink that is Warframe.  So, 3000 hours of having Warfarm launched, and I still haven't spent a penny (it's about the statement now). Money in this game can be a tradeoff for time played- there's this currency called Platinum that can be used in everything but also costs real money. But you can get plat by trading with people who have plat and basically use other people's money to upgrade your stuff. It's probably my favorite thing that Warframe does that other games don't. Though if I had spent money, I could probably have hit MR30 at around 1k hours rather than 3k but I enjoy the grind so it's really up to you.  uhhh... apparently new player experience could also use a ton of work so pls have a friend teach you everything in warframe before you start :D",Recommended,2017.12.02,4.0

If you can figure out the core mechanics (especially modding your weapons and frames), you'll be fine (protip: the community is not bad, ask for help, but not handouts, if you need it). Also the warframe wiki is your best friend for finding stuff and figuring stuff out.  There are a bunch of frames (character you play as) and even more weapons (like seriously, there are so many). So you can tailor your loadout to any playstyle you want. Want to be perma-invisible and nail everybody with a bow and arrow? Want to be a mega-tank (my favorite playstyle cause I'm lazy)? Want to be a hyper-mobile glass cannon? You can do all of these. Maybe not right off the bat, but eventually.  Ok, here is the make or break about warframe. As you can see from my hours played, there is a lot to do if you are in to this kinda thing. This is both good and bad. Good because there is always something to do. Bad because.....there is always something to do. Warframe is not a game you can ""beat."" Yes, I know this standard for these MMO type of games, but I think it needs to be said. Its a slow burn. If you try to binge, or rush this, you are gonna have a subpar experience. My favorite thing about warframe is that it allows you to hop on, do a thing or two (with or with out friends), and hop off. If you want to binge it, the game will not stop you, its just that you may find yourself burnt out fairly quickly of you do that.  Speaking of MMO, lets talk monetization. Warframe is free to play, but I think that is monetized properly. Yes, you can buy almost anything if you shell out he cash, but what often goes unnoticed is that you can get all frames and weapons by playing the game, no real money required. You can also get premium currency by trading with other players. So essentially, the premium currency is a pay real money to skip the grind and trade type thing. Is this the best model? No, it is not, but is is a lot better than other systems. Also, there are no loot boxes, which is nice. Yes, there are relics you can open (by playing a mission) for a chance to get parts for making gear, but there is no premium currency involved unless you use premium currency to buy it off another player.  So, its a good game, with incredible customization (gameplay and fashion), wonderful quests (not spoiling those here, they are great, trust me), fair monetization, and a pretty good community. But it also has one the worst (but prettiest) tutorials I have ever seen. Its definitely a slow burn, but it is a great game like no other. Give it a try, I mean its free, what do you have to lose?",Recommended,2022.12.30,10.0

There are times when I want to get serious and there are missions for that. Highly recommend giving it a few hours.

Beyond speeding up timers or unlocking characters or cosmetic fashion(frame) items there is absolutely no need to pay to ""advance"" the game.  Lots of the mission types are skill based in any case, so no amount of platinum (in game currency) will buy you success.  The game itself is a extremely solid third person shooter. Satisfying. Very. Think destiny with more stuff to do.  Community is absolutely ace too. Vets will actively join you to help you get what you need. And you'll need a lot. Metric ton of blueprints and weapons to try out.  Also, I have no idea just how many characters there are. I thought street fighter had a large roster!

The combat feels rewarding, the customization feels rewarding, the MODDING feels rewarding. Compared to Destiny, Warframe makes you feel powerful. Nothing is paid for, you can grind for everything you need and that is the best thing a free to play game can offer. There is also an in-game MARKET DEVELOPED BY THE COMMUNITY that lets you trade in-game items for the games premium paid currency. However, this game has a terrible sense of guidance for new players so it's recommended you look up guides to see what you must do to progress. Have fun!",Recommended,2024.03.22,1.0
Warframe,Laytnor,"Product received for free  Eh, it's ok. Gets a bit repetitive after some hours, and content recently either takes too damn long to be pushed out, or does not really meet players expectations. That being said, it's a solid hour dump and you'll find plenty of things to do as a new player.  Warning, though. For the new players, the UI can be really confusing and some market stuff might make you falsely believe that you need to dump real money to get things like warframes and guns in the game, which couldn't be further from the truth. You can easily get blueprints for all weapons in clan dojos and craft them easily with materials you get from playing, and as for cosmetics, prime warframe and weapons, you can easily earn Platinum (premium in-game currency used in the marketplace and to rush stuff you craft) by either opening relics for prime parts which you use to craft said prime warframes or weapons, or outright selling it to other players for platinum which you can use for whatever you want, such as marketplace cosmetics, warframe and weapon slots, etc. The only exception is community made tennogen cosmetics which you can only get with real money. Trust me, first impressions can be misleading, but this is honestly one of the most fair f2p games in the market. Wouldn't waste my time with it otherwise.  And a little advice, don't blow that platinum as a new player on weapons and warframes, it's a ripoff because you can easily craft it yourself. And don't immediately blow it on cosmetics either. Keep it for weapon and warframe slots, you will need it.",Recommended,2020.06.01,2.0

The newer updates are dreadful in my eyes and I feel like the game has lost its touch, so the Warframe I knew and enjoyed I will be forever thankful for and the friends I made during this time, playing and having fun together.

Was fun, was free and that was it all.  2017 I, a forgotten tenno, came back to Warframe for another battle. I realized story fragments, enjoyed the narratives and understood some of the content and features. I saw that warframe can be whatever i need from a game. I took what i needed. Challenges, levelling, collecting loot and earning new equipment. Progress was satisfying. I saw that i delevoped and became a better tenno. I saw that Warframe changed and became a better game. But the possibilities made me fear the effort i would need to reach the stars. And after a while, in which i tried to reach perfection as a tenno, i abandoned Warframe again.  2019 The urge to serve a greater good is strong in me now. A tenno came back after he found his inner self on a journey of loneliness. I know the challenges and more will be there to come. I know my enemies and more will be after my soul. I know the way to perfection and more obstacles will be there to overcome. A tenno needs patience, mercy and will to understand this game and to see what lays beyond the obvious.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get Warframe to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my Warframe and color, and started playing, but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he helped me.

Warframe,Morgan the Fish,"Warframe is by far my favorite game and most likely will be for all time. It's a beautiful game that runs on nearly all systems. The game is a third person shooter focused on PvE with character abilities, quality gunplay, and unlike most shooters Melee is a perfectly viable alternative.  Almost every gun has a different feel and or use than any other gun even if both are snipers, shotguns or any other subset of gun. They all sound different and look different except in a few cases in which some guns have superior versions of the same gun with the same name and a minor change in visuals. The melee weapons in the game follow the same theme in that every melee weapon is different than all the other melee weapons in use and visuals aside from a few that have superior versions. All of these weapons can be used to a large extent in most of the gameplay aside from a few of the beggining ones obviously meant for newer players in lower tier content.  On to the ""Player Characters"" the Warframes themselves, each and every Warframe is vastly different from all the others when it comes to powers. For example, theres a frame that freezes enemies in time, an invisible robin hood like bow frame, one that controls the bodies of the dead, and another that makes gaint walls of glass while coating enemies in it. That said, every frame is capable of quick movement all across the maps you'll encounter with a bit of practice, they can all roll, sprint, super jump, double jump, wall run, and dash on tightwires. High power characters moving at a quick fun pace.  The enemies in the game are 4 real factions, Grineer (Cloned soldiers clad in armor using ballistic weapons.), Corpus (High tech robots and merchants who worship money as their religion.), Infested (Units from the two previous factions and enemies of an age long past infected with a biological weapon and connected to a network of hive minds.), and Sentients (Self aware synthetic life forms created to adapt to anything and everything long ago.). As you go through the game, the enemy units will get significantly more challenging as you yourself also grow stronger. With enough work you can mow them down like grass, or you could be the grass yourself.  Now on to the free to play aspect, if any game deserves that title, Warframe is that game. Warframe has the cleanest free to play game I have ever played. All weapons and Warframes are free to obtain. Everything in the game can be obtained without premium currency except cosmetics. If you want cosmetics? Don't worry, you can trade items earned in the game for premium currency and other players do this, all the time. Theres very few cosmetics that can't be earned this way and the only reason for that is because they weren't designed by the Warframe team and were made by creative players, the money spent on them turns into a bit of cash in the wallet of the players who created it. No fret though, the cosmetics made by the Warframe team are great if you have no money for player made cosmetics.  For a game that was truly terrible and boring when it first came out, it's impressive beyond anything else. This is a game that truly puts almost every triple A game to shame, most other indie games, and every other free to play game. I love this game and I love the people in it, this is probably the most friendly community in any game.

Warframe,100 die already,"Having played this game for the majority of it's lifetime thus far and seen its ebbs and flows, I will leave a word here and try not to spoil too much. It'll be a bit of a long read.  ---- Warframe is massive, gripping in profound ways, and for several reasons among the best games ever made in my opinion. As I see it, the elements of greatest pull are the movement mechanics, combat, quasi-gambling, lore and community. To me, the notable flaws are some pretty harsh bugs, P2P-hosted multiplayer, and a steep obscure learning curve. I may as well add the developers propensity for creating content islands to the flaws, even though it's not done in such a way I personally feel is a turn-off.  ____ Pros:  The movement is really satisfying in pretty much every part of the game. Moving around with your warframe makes you feel strong, limber, well-honed. Running, jumping, gliding through the air, flipping around like nobody's business. There are vehicles and other characters that you get to move around as well, and the movement of those feel well-suited too. Let's say you're controlling something really bulky, then you feel that heft all the way. Maybe you're controlling something a bit weaker, then the way that behaves makes it feel more on the frail side, etc.  Combat in Warframe makes you feel like a true murder machine, but not in a Mary-Sue cookie-clicker kind of way. As long as you engage with the game, you get to feel like a god. The movement is one big part of it, with a lot of enemy types with different weapons, units that can afflict debuffs on you if you're not careful, etc. At higher levels, those debuffs can easily spell your immediate demise. The gunplay and melee is well-crafted with a wide array of choices to go for. Some weapons get things done better than others in certain cases, which in turn has unavoidably created meta for the game. The thing is, you can still use most anything and get the same results using different combination of character abilities and 'mods'. The quickest summary of mods I can do is probably ""gear-attachable items that change the output and in some cases mechanics of a piece of gear."" Modding your gear to work with you and not against you in combat is fundamental, and a lot of fun. Experimenting with different mod builds for your gear is almost a game in itself. You also have companions and summonables (either through gear items or character abilities), that will help you in battle. This is just a few things that I think are fantastic with the combat, but I'll cut it off here as not to make this centered totally around this one point.  Speaking of mods however, going onto what I think is one of the most conflict-inducing points about this game you can bring up: RNG. Random number generation deciding what loot you get and if you even get it at all in a lot of cases. I call it quasi-gambling because it is scratching that same itch in your brain but you aren't sacrificing anything but time. One could argue that the time you put into trying to get loot on an RNG-basis is equatable to real-world money. And I would disagree. Crucially, the things you are doing to get the drops are still fun. If you play this game in a strictly completionist way, you will burn out like a candle in a crematorium. That's not the path the game tries to lead you down though, and not the intent of the developers.  The lore is pretty in-depth, even if it isn't all splayed out in the quests or in missions. It's touching and has some serious complexity to it in places. I won't say much more about it. It's really, truly nice. There are fragments of lore you can collect in different ways, to know more about the story. So the story doesn't often pose a roadblock for progression, which definitely feels like it is the case in some games. I say often though, because there are a few clefts of lore that roughly divide the game up in sections. This is positive, because the player being forced to go through this specific part of the lore also gives important exposition and gear for content that follows. Without these dividers, it would probably feel pretty lukewarm progressing through the game.  The community. A lot of games exist separate from their communities. Warframe, not so. Plenty of things in the game are influenced by the community or directly taken from community ideas. Digital Extremes listens to their community, values feedback and interacts with their community often. Feedback can feel like it's left on 'read', but taking into account the gargantuan levels of feedback the community shoots the devs' way, the staff taking in all of it and relaying it down the line seems like quite the small group. It's no surprise some things either take a long time to process or are just lost by the wayside when the community is this active. The game is invariably affected by the community, because the developers recognizes the value of letting the community be part of developing the game. Not to mention Warframe seems to attract mostly really wonderful and caring people. It's a very welcoming place, in comparison to many other places online.  ____ Cons:  Bugs. The game breaks in a variety of ways, and updates often brings new bugs onto the table. Most of them are annoying at worst, but there are some that can screw you over royally. The ones that hurt the most are the ones that renders the client unable to update your account after a mission. As an example, let's return to the RNG-aspect. You've done an endurance mission for a good while, maybe you've stayed an hour or so fighting in a mission to get a reward and you finally get it. Then, when you finish up the mission the game doesn't update your account and you lose the stuff you got in the mission. It bites hard. Loot not dropping isn't nearly as bad as getting the loot and the game just not giving it to you. This ties into the next point: multiplayer sessions are player-hosted. The worst bugs happen due to poor connectivity between client and host in most cases. If you play solo, most of the bugs won't occur. Likewise, if your connection and the host's is solid, the bugs won't happen as much.  The game also does a poor job explaining some pretty important things. Some things are stowed away in menus people just miss, some are briefly mentioned in a tip in a corner of a loading screen, some things are just left out totally. The game clearly wants you to find stuff out on your own, but for a lot of players it proves an insurmountable task. The community always steps in and helps out if someone asks for help in the chats, but it shouldn't be left only to the community to do this, imo. This isn't necessarily a downside for everyone, just that for a lot of players it really feels like you're thrown into the deep end of the pool. If you're not into exploring and just want the game to tell you what to do, it can be rough. Ask in chat though, your fellow players will get you on track.  Content islands are an issue raised many times. The devs have on occasion tried implement ways to fix it but the problem remains. I'm pretty neutral to having the different parts of the game divided up like they are. If anything, it gives you a reason to play more when a new ""island"" drops. But the frustration people have with it is very much valid. Again, seems to me it's not something the devs forgotten, but just haven't figured out. So there's that. It really doesn't constitute a problem that hinders the game flow much beyond sometimes feeling kind of stranded in particular content. When that happens, it's easy to hit up chat for some people to play with. The playerbase is active a lot of the time.  ____ Across the board, Warframe is a stimulating, colorful, time-consuming, emotional experience. I haven't even scraped the surface here, and after many years I still feel excitement playing the game. You got time to invest in a game and like scifi, fantasy and action?

As time passed and talking to friends that still played WF, their comment was, ""you are not going to recognize it.""  WARFRAME 2017 Holy Smokes! Things have changed! Digital Extremes really stuck to their guns and put everything into WF and didn't stop.  The start of the game begins like DC Universe. I cringed at that thought until the story pulled it self into Warframe and Wow! What a blast! The core of WF gameplay is still there, but the over all world of WF has changed for the better. Much better!  I'm very happy with what has become of WF and highly recommend if you are looking for an online shooter that may be played Co-op or solo. Either way WF is a great game!

Warframe,Clueless,"You know what Warframe has got over every other game? Ambition. There's a lot to love in Warframe, and a lot of stuff to do. It's super pretty looking and it feels great to experience.  My biggest complaint with the game is ""why?""  For what do we grind for? Why do we get all this stuff?  Player vs Player? No way. Literally 5 people play PVP, which is a SHAME! My favorite thing about other, similar games like Destiny 2 is the connection between PVP and PVE. You bring your gear into PVP, and that makes you feel triumph when you win!  Warframe doesn't really have that. I recently finished a build I really liked. After years of casual play, I finally had maxed out this build. I was so happy, and then I thought, ""so what do I do with it?""  Do I just do more pve? I mean sure, but I was already doing that. Why do I need to keep doing what I was doing when it's way easier now?  Warframe has a lot of stuff to do but there is no goal. You get all of this stuff by fighting cool enemies and bosses but there is no higher calling. I think PVP could solve that, but that's just my opinion. I don't know, maybe I'm missing the point. But that's how I feel, and I'd still recommend playing the game. Been here 7 years and I'll be here for years to come.  -From a casual enjoyer of games",Recommended,2022.04.14,2.0

Warframe,Archill,"Warframe is one of the most unique games that I have played. I don't think I can name any games that are similar to Warframe. I'll walk through how this game works and I will give a disclaimer that this review has SPOILERS for later parts of the game (not including the story quests in detail).  Warframe is a Sci-Fi Looter Shooter game that has been running for over 10 years. It features hundreds of weapons and warframes that are craftable and earned through numerous sources. Warframes are the ""characters"" you play as that have 4 different abiltiies. Most of the warframes in the game have a ""Prime"" variant that has better stats than their original counterparts.  All weapons and warframes are ""upgraded"" by using a mod system. There are mods found across the game that you can earn that do a lot of different things. A few examples of what can do is they can increase the strength of abiltiies, the duration they last or the amount of energy they use. Mods are the backbone for weapons and warframes in this game, so they are a key part of buildcrafting.  The amount of content available to play in Warframe is astonishing for a free to play game. The star chart is the main progression route for newer players and it involves going from mission to mission across different planets, doing different quests and objectives. There is repetition in the types of missions you will do such as exterminate, capture, sabotage, defense, interception and more. Some planets have unique mission types, but these are what you will likely be playing the most.  All weapons and warframes start at level 0, and all warframes and most weapons have a max level of 30 (with some weapons being 40). Leveling weapons, warframes, intrinsics, necramechs, archwings, gear and completing nodes in star chart will all contribute affinity (another word for XP) towards your mastery rank. Mastery Rank is one of the main ways of progression and allows you to unlock new weapons, mod types and certain content within the game. There are other benefits, but these are the main reasons to increase your mastery rank.  Warframe also has a very convoluted narrative which can be explored by progressing through the main quests in the game. I won't talk about the story much here because it does have a ton of spoilers that I don't want to ruin for new players.  Aside from the usual mission nodes in planets, there are other types of missions in Warframe. There are currently 3 open-world areas found in Earth, Deimos and Zariman (and I won't be explaining much about the Zariman area). These open-world areas have bounties to replace normal mission nodes and give unique rewards tailored to that area. Aside from the open-world areas, there is a new area released in the Duviri Paradox expansion that added an open-world area that acts as a roguelike RPG that changes each time you play it.  Once completing the entire star chart, there is new content to explore afterwards. Steel Path becomes available to you, which replaces the entire star chart with Steel Path modifiers to make enemies much harder in terms of health, armor and damage. This isn't set in stone, and you can swap between steel path and normal star chart. The benefit of completing Steel Path aside from mastery rank is that mod and resource drops are greatly increased, so you can earn more rewards for completing missions in Steel Path. Steel Essence is also earned from Steel Path missions, which is a currency that can be exchanged for unique resources. As well as Steel Path, there is a new activity unlocked called Arbitration. This activity features a rotation of activities that give you a lot of unique rewards and endo (which is used to upgrade mods).  I don't want to fully explain everything in this game, but there is so much to do in this game and I don't feel bored when playing because you can always do something different.

Warframe,Lellodee,"For those of you who played before 2016, take note - Since The Second Dream's release, Warframe has been extensively given a lot of love and care and is beyond a mere game's worth of content.  For those who are new:  Ever wanted a Free to Play game that's actually NOT PAY TO WIN? Warframe's it, despite looking like a Pay to Win at first glance. Warframes and weapons can be built from the blueprints in-store and the blueprints you earn either in boss fights or the materials you find playing naturally in-game. Prime Warframes and Weapons can be earned through Void Relics and easily traded for Platinum (The game's premium currency) in an economy that easily makes it possible for completely Free-To-Play players to enjoy the game's cosmetics and easily gather the resources they need with a little effort.  Everything takes a short amount of time to farm, and a long time to cook - But if you pace yourself well, you can accomplish a lot within a week of playing this game once you're past the early hours. This game doesn't hold your hand, however - Expect to get confused with the modding and forma system at first, but it's a satisfying learning experience reminiscent of 90s gaming (Where you actually put some bloody effort into your games.)  Combat is fluid, free-form - The parkour system is genuinely fun to use and fits well with the fast-paced combat of the game. Digital Extremes (Who have history in AAA-gaming before this - The Darkness 2 was a great game if not short) are consistently providing their love and support into the game alongside informing the community of their future plans for the game.  Hands down I would recommend this game - I mean, my friend's got 7k hours on it so clearly she must find a reason to keep playing it since launch... :)",Recommended,2018.04.28,686.8

The missions, while repetitive at times, are enjoyable. Especially if you have a friend with you. There is a great variety of Frames, Weapons and Mods to challenge yourself to learn. Co-op is easy, and lag-free as far as what I've experienced.  The cons are: The game can bug out at times. Missions can be slightly repetitive, as said before.

Warframe,ArachniaTK,"Just about every Looter Shooter I've tried over the years has fallen short of anything longlasting for me. Always I see the ""Meh, I'll just keep playing Warframe"" from countless individuals that have delved in to the AAA Looter Shooters and true enough, after giving it a solid amount of playtime in my first week, I feel these statements about Warframe are indeed warranted.  Impressions: 1. I zoomed out on the map and went ""There's THIS MUCH CONTENT IN A FREE GAME?!?!"" 2. This game is polished. I mean like you can see your reflection it's so polished. 3. Fortuna is now my 2nd all-time favorite town in a videogame (Only behind Tristram...for me). Such unique and creative content!!!  I'm hooked, and I highly doubt I'll be buying any other Looter Shooter after Destiny 2 (which I quit after a week), and I'm glad I didn't bother to buy Anthem. Warframe is complete, and is so much more deserving of my money and support. Thank you Digital Extremes, you guys and gals are a cut above the rest!",Recommended,2019.03.11,54.6

Warframe,Balsco,"What is Warframe? It's a question many ask and don't find a satisfying answer for, so I'll try my best to explain it in a succint manner:  Warframe is a third-person shooter, with heavy action elements such as parkour and a satisfying melee combat system. Warframe is a looter and an RPG, you go into missions to collect resources and blueprints to craft new equipment for yourself, these range from new weapons, which can be ranged or melee, to new Warframes, each with their own set of abilities, to new companions, and all of these pieces of equipment can be enhanced and altered with mods which you will collect as you play.  Warframe has some of the best art direction and I daresay my favourite art-style of any sci-fi universe, there's heavy elements of biotech, and each enemy faction in the game has a distinct aesthetic that ties into their background, and the way they fight.  Regarding monetization, like many other reviews have said, Warframe's monetization is fair and plenty of players play through the game with no disadvantages without spending a cent.  A review about Warframe is not complete without mentioning its origins and success, Warframe is a free-to-play indie game, but it has achieved great success in spite of this, because you will be hard pressed to find a team of developers that communicates better than Warframe's, their community team has streams from Monday to Thursday consistently, and Fridays have a biweekly devstream where the community coordinator, the creative director, the design director and the art director just sit on a couch and talk to the players about their plans, about what's next for the game, and they also answer players' questions. I have not played any game that comes close to Warframe when it comes to how the developers engage with their players and community.",Recommended,2020.03.01,5.0

Warframe,NMBR1MRTL,"You are awoken rudely by the vile Grineer Captain Vor, who has discovered a Tenno, a Space Ninja on the wild planet Earth. He gloats and tries to claim you as a prize for his evil Queens of the Grineer, but you break free with the help of the mysterious Lotus, a beautiful woman seeking more Tenno like yourself.    Lotus brings you up to speed in a galactic war on a constantly-updating scale. Your countless Tenno brethren appear with an inevitable regularity, Lotus explains, a new Tenno bringing new armor and equipment with the strange, alien biosuits.  You are immediately reminded of , the symbiotic alien bioweapons in which Solid Snake and Luke Skywalker starred in, and you had shared a movie night or two with Summer-Rain in the shadowy realm of the friendzone before you became an item with her years later.  You think back on how all this led to her passing and how you took the loss by losing yourself in Dark Souls. How the allowed you to phase between worlds and how Novocaine's Three allowed you to both come to terms with her loss. Now in a cosmic frontier of space ninjas, evil cloned descendants of humanity and a scavenging corporation of another branch of evil mankind, your path is clear - become the best space ninja with an insane selection of armor, weapons and so much customization options that you don't know where to begin.  From Mars to Sedna, Saturn to the far- flung reaches of mysterious areas of space known as , your mission controller, Lotus, is a mix of roles; mother, sister, long-distance pesudo-lover. You undertake missions on her behalf to protect the galaxy and the stake that all Tenno represent, the last portion of humanity that did not produce the bloodthirsty conquest- driven or the overly-monitized faction. You take the fight to the space zombies; the , and learn how to craft better weapons and warframes along the way, painting all you use and own in dull colors of green and blue, trying your best to honor the memory of your erstwhile love.  After what seems like months in space, you meet others who share your role in the universe as Tenno. They pair up on missions with you, but it is silent, almost hollow. You listen to the next orders of the Lotus but even then it seems like it is part of a motion. Then you realize who Lotus has reminded you of behind her concealed face and her eyes- none other than your ex, herself.  Trying to break free from the indirect siren song of her voice and orders over your warframe, you are powerless. On this new mission to one of the far-flung Dark Sectors, you decide on a gambit and set your ship on a crash course into the nebula. Lotus Novocaine knows this however, and other Tenno are dispatched to retrieve the wayward son. This detour of the galaxy taking a dark turn, you don't want to face your fellow Tenno, old friends from a forgotten time, now under the control of the Lotus.  She offers peace, security and longevity, happiness as an eternity with her, doing her bidding so that the galaxy remains safe. In another time, you would gladly have been one of hers. But not now. Not when you are pledged to another, and you have a promise to keep. The risks of the nebula be damned. You factor in course correct before your Tenno close in and punch it. Once more, the Lotus faces the cold stars of the cosmos as you ride within the nebula, closer to a home where you belong.",Recommended,2017.11.09,92.3

Warframe,Kennot,"Tl;dr: If you generally dislike grinding, this isn't the game for you. If you don't mind ALOT of it, you'll barely manage to stay sane for the first few hours. If you plan to go past just a few hours... Whatever sanity remained, it will slowly be disintegrated as you continue to play, but at least you'll be having a load of fun by then ^^  I like to generalize the Warframe experience in 3 phases; The new player, The general player, The masochi- I mean, The true space ninja  The New Player: Most who just started the game would feel very overwhelmed after completing the first few intial missions, as there is literially no more given help or tips on what to do next. But to make up for the lack of assisstance, most of the community would be willing to help you out if you just ask. Hell even sometimes give you free stuff to start off.  The General Player: This is where the majority of both new and old players either get loads burnouts or just straight up quit the game. As all they see is 'grind, grind, grind, and more grind'. Yes that is basically the entire game, but that means they're missing the 'hidden' message of the game (not really, just wanted to make it sound cool)  To put it simply in my own words.. Because it's fun. You're probably thinking ""How the hell can endless hours of constant grinding be fun"" or something along those lines. Well that's the exact same mindset for those new and old players who did quit the game, which leads to the final phase.  The True Space Ninja: As repetitive any gamemode may be in Warframe, the amount of frames and weapons to choose from make the grind not just bearable, but legitimately fun. Even the worst kinds of weapons can be surprisngly effective or do the most hilarious things you would not see in any other game. The joy of bringing the wrong set up to a mission, then finding out by the end it worked better than expected.  To avoid making this review anymore lenghty, I would say to truly enjoy Warframe; Change your usual set-up for certain mission types, challenge yourself with small but fun objectives while in mission, helping other players can be either fustrating to funny experiences or a nice break from the constant grinding",Recommended,2017.04.20,1.0

Warframe,Captain Masterson,"Warframe has come a long way from when i first started playing, but i can honestly say the majority of it was great! Let me start by describing what warframe is. Its an over the shoulder third-person shooter where you play the role of a ninja warrior in space. The solar system is in chaos, and it's up to you to maintain the balance. With many weapon types to choose from, and different frames to use to suit your playstyle, the possibilities are endless. However there are certain strategies in higher level missions that even veteran players will tell you work. It's pretty much an MMO at this point, so certain ""classes"" of warframes work better at farming resources on certain missions. The developers also release new content as operations to introduce the new features, for example, the newest addition was corpus dropships that drop squads of enemies into battle. It was introduced as Operation: Ambulas Reborn, which featured a reworked boss that dropped in from the ship with a squad of regular enemies. There were a few bugs at first, but the incredibly awesome support team was very quick to respond to reports and get back within 24-48 hours. All in all, this has become one of the best free to play games i have ever played, and the graphics do an excellent job of immersing you in a living, breathing world that is constantly changing. I have to say that there are certain aspects of the game which require you to pay for features. Such as certain weapons, cosmetic packs, etc. Other than that, if you work hard and spend a decent amount of time on it, everything important is attainable without paying money for it. I do encourage you to support the developers by buying things that you may like, but only at your own discretion. Speaking of which, there is also a thriving market for the ingame currency, platinum, where you can spend platinum to buy parts, weapon mods, and other hard to obtain aspects from other players, as well as selling your own parts and mods to other players to obtain platinum. The prices will indeed vary on the rarity of what you are trying to get, but there is also sites and a wiki for any questions you may have about said things.

Warframe,Jimbus Nimbus,"This game is a game where prety much EVERYTHING can be obtained through trade and patience. I have reached the point of the game where all I have left to do is collect a few weapons and cosmetics, in which I have made the money (platinum) for on my own time. As a high ranking player, I have seen many types of players and many changes throughout the game. The gameplay and trading in Warframe are merciless to those who start out the game, but provides an interesting learning experience to read the minds of the person on the other side of the screen. It took me a couple of hours to just figure out the parkour mechanics, and many more to be able to hold my ground against enemies that you may think are stupid at first, but then realize that they are stupid, but hit hard. Even with the legendary grind this game has striked into players, I remain playing the game, seeing new content put out that never fails to impress. If you are looking for a game where you can casually spend time with friends, be astounded by the copypasta maps that always hold great beauty, laugh at the funny bugs that can be found on rare occassions, fight for the ""honor"" of the merciless tenno, or find a challenge mastering the game's distinct mechanics and unmatched third-person combat, then I welcome you to join Warframe.",Recommended,2016.06.11,7.0

My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn it's simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist.

I've spent entire steelpath runs with random people just chatting or trying to help someone else with their builds or discussing our various warframe builds.

Warframe,AriaOfOurs,"Warframe is an impressive work of a game. You might think, just by looking at its store page with the ""Free to Play"" tag and the ""dlc"" packs underneath that it's Pay to Win. That is not the case. Not even a little bit. You can obtain everything non-cosmetic in the game without paying a dime. You can even trade rare items for the in-game currency, platinum. So you really can get everything without paying.  You start off with little, taking a weapon of choice for a Primary, Secondary and a Melee weapon, as well as one of three Warframes. Your Warframe has certain abilities that set it aside from others. As you master your weapons and Warframe, The Lotus takes notice and allows you to test your abilities and Rank Up. After you've ranked up, you now have access to better weaponry to take on bigger things.  The mission variety is good, the amount of weapons can be overwhelming, but there's always something to do. Give this game a shot. DE is an excellent company, they do livestreams every other Friday(could be mistaken on schedule) and talk about what's going on, what they're working on and what they want to do. They listen to feedback from everywhere; Steam Forums(ugh), their own forums, or even Reddit. They are not a greedy company. Give the game a try, it's pretty fun.",Recommended,2015.01.14,3.0

Warframe,Rynea,"Warframe is a Space-Ninja themed and heavily Co-Op focused third person shooter, with various elements that remind of RPG and collection games, as well as action combat and fast paced movement.  You fight your way across various missions in the solar system, running quests and various challenges, all while collecting parts to build up your arsenal of weapons and ""warframes"", suits of armor that could be interpreted as classes in other games, each coming with a set of different abilities.  Nice graphics, smooth animations, combined with a huge variety of content, decent lore and a plethora of weapons and abilities as well as a big amount of customization, both with said weapons and abilities as well as the looks of your gear, let this game stand out among it's rather bland first and third person shooter peers.  The community is overall very approachable and friendly, while you will find nice people and morons everywhere in every game, as it is a co-op focused game rather than pvp, the majority of players are rather easy going. The game itself is rather casual friendly.  There are not many missions that make it possible for a single person to determine success or failure and in the 4 player missions, having one or two experienced people is nearly always enough to complete the content, further encouraging new players to hang out with veterans.  The sheer amount of content can be overwhelming, but there are not many restrictions that are limiting veterans from playing with new players and reaching what can be considered end game can be rather easy, especially if a new player specialized in one or two warframes.  Progression is going sideways rather than in a single direction, it will take a long time to get all the weapons and warframes, but this doesn't prevent you from using your acquired weapons to run high level content.  The game is one of the best in its genre when it comes to a free to play approach, offering pretty much all content in some way or form without the need to pay for it. Even the premium currency that is used to buy cosmetic enhancements like skins or ease of life stuff like boosters for acquiring more resources and ingame credits, can be traded for items you acquire ingame, as such easily available for free to play people as well.  Maybe most importantly, none of the paid currency is related to anything that makes you stronger than a player who is not using premium currency. They might get to their goals a little faster, but not in any way that makes a big difference.  The most negative aspects of Warframe in its current state is probably the interface and places where you find the things you might need. Especially as a new player its easy to get lost with all the different menus and there is way more complexity than necessary, making it feel unstructured at times.  Unlike PvP heavy games, the atmosphere is much better with Warframe's co-op approach than many other games. A definite plus for everyone who is tired of brain damaged idiots who rage about lack of skills while playing in game sessions tagged for beginners, quite common in certain Mobas.  Overall a very enjoyable game, especially if you want a relaxed and easy going approach to a looter shooter in space, without strings attached and no pressure either from the content or most importantly your peers.",Recommended,2019.12.15,2.0
Warframe,DikerdodlePlays,"Fun game to get into with a lot to do. The new player experience is terrible, though, so get used to reading the wiki and viewing tutorials. In order to really like the game you need to be able to set goals for yourself because the game never explicitly tells you what you can or should do next. My recommendation is to just complete as many missions in the star chart as you can and enjoy the story quests that begin to pop up on the later planets. The Second Dream and The War Within are probably the two best pieces of content the game has to offer in terms of story and cinematic experiences. As for other content, Plains of Eidolon and Fortuna are awesome as well. I still have yet to kill or capture an Eidolon and have no clue about anything regarding the orb mothers. It may appear to be pay to win at first but it's really not, as you can earn everything in-game via trading and grinding, and the things you can purchase really don't have much of an effect on the way the game is played since you still have to level them up and mod them to be able to play higher end content.  In short, it's free to play, if you're interested give it a try. It's not for everyone but I'd always recommend trying it. Who knows, you might like it.",Recommended,2020.05.17,551.0

Yes they have a pay system, but this gives you really no advantage as its just a fast way to gain items instead of waiting for items to be built.  Having friends I will say is key, so join up and make some as its a very friendly community and playing solo isn't as fun...  In terms of content, they update the game every so often, so more and more is being add.  If you love MMO, you should love this game as the gameplay is great, unique ( both in story and content), awesome community, the freedom is great ( customization, missions ). You can even create your own clan building known as a Dojo.  Yes the game can be ""Grindy"" , but please tell me a single game that doesn't have some sort of grind system.... Or does everyone want to have everything within a week...  I've personally played for the story and find the universe that is placed before you as a player is one of a kind.

If you cant be bothered to read me yapping (i don't blame you) then TL;DR: Warframe is a time-consuming but rewarding game. Try it.  I have been playing Warframe for a good few hundred hours (on Ps4 and that's why i only have a few hours on steam) and i am absolutely am no expert on this game but i believe i can provide some good points for this game. Warframe is a incredibly grindy game that often needs lots of time and motivation to complete certain tasks, but it does the grinding in a way that i think can still be fun whether your a new player, a player that's pretty knowledgeable of the game or even a veteran player since day 1.The grinding can most definitely be time consuming and sometimes tedious but i think the reward and feeling you get for completing something you have been working towards is amazing and very gratifying. Warframe isn't the game for everyone but i believe if you are looking for a long term game it is definitely a good pick. In total, i do really think Warframe is a good and unique game with all its systems, modding, playstyles and the (somewhat) wholesome community there is to find.

Though each mission even if you do the same one is always different. The maps in this game use specifc locations but put them together differently each time.  In addition this game has alot of parkor moments and alot of hidden places to find and go to. If you can get there chances are there is something hidden there.  This game uses a cash shop although using it is easy its not always the best thing to do...as you still have to play. Alot of the game is unlocked by completing specifc missions and leveling up your items and you own character. The cash shop also allows you to use in game cash to get certain items like scanners and blueprints....but also lets you spend real cash to do the same thing.  Your character has what is called a mastery rank this is raised by completing tests. To unlock the ability to complete a test you again have to play the game. Your items, warframe, weapons, sentinels, etc, all have levels as they go up levels you gain more experience thus can eventualy do a test you unlock another mastery rank.  In a way this game can be very grindy, but with each frame offering 5 differing powers and a differing look and considering you can choose whatever weapons you want it makes this game have alot of replay ability.  My only gripe is a few things....the tutorial and help stuff isnt very good....at times i didnt see what i was supposed to do next and didnt see the small text explaining my powers or how i could open certain lockers etc. In addition I literally had to look some things up on a warframe wiki or just found out after readiong some of the in game players chatting about differing things.   Also many missions seam to just all together give up on stealth....there you are sneaking around taking your time....and suddenly everything comes after you.  I tend to do things slowly....i like to ninja the missions in games...kill them all so to speak at times.....but this game sometimes forces me to run out.  Fissure missions, bounty missions and infested missions all have this global they come right at you thing.....no matter where you are.....its very annoying.  This in turn makes me miss items and hidden stuff....which is annoying and disapointing.  All in all i recommend this game.  They are continualy updating and fixing things....the newest frame called the titania is alot of fun to play.  All i need now is a cat one(cat ears and a tail on a female frame) i can already think of what it would have on it.  Sooo in conclusion....play this game....its free after all.",Recommended,2016.09.17,5.0
Warframe,decizion,"Great game and still one of the best free to play out there.  I first played it years ago when it came out both on pc and ps4 but for some reasons I couldn't get much into it. As I was kinda bored recently I decided to revisit the game and oh boy it really does have evolved so much after all these years. Still that fast paced ninja action, good graphics and great gameplay but everything have been greatly improved and perfected. Movements are ultra smooth, very fast paced, weapons are really satisfying, honestly it's an absolute blast to play.  There's so much content and so many things to do in this game. It's absolutely massive and to be honest it can be overwhelming for new players. But if you have the time, if you are willing to get involved and also if your not against doing some research to learn the different systems in the game trust me you will get hundreds of hours of fun with Warframe. Having the fanmade wiki open in your browser while playing is pretty much mandatory.  In this game pretty much everything can be acquired for free (except some premium cosmetics). Given that you have the time to grind to unlock that content of course, if not then it's still possible to pay for stuff to unlock early on. So yeah, unlike Destiny 2 there's no content hidden behind paywalls.  Only thing i dislike about this game is that Digital Extremes sold out to the chinese group Leyou and now it's been bought back by Tencent. And that is not good at all for the future in my opinion. Steam players helped to make this game a success and now we are at the mercy of Epic-Tencent anti consumers policies. Pretty sad if you ask me.  Anyway overall Warframe is a pretty good game which i highly recommend.",Recommended,2021.01.30,3.0

Microtransactions exist but you can get everything in the market, apart from some cosmetics, through gameplay or even trading with other people. No content is locked behind a paywall either which is pretty nice. Fair warning tho, this game is a huge time sink and will eventually give you a god complex to the point you'll start itching if you don't manage to kill everything on the map within 2 seconds. There's also the super heavy RNG based farming which can also be very annoying at times. Good game to play tho especially while listening to music or watching something on the side.",Recommended,2024.09.24,1.0
Warframe,-END OF LINE-,"What to say about Warframe?  Quite a bit and perhaps some not to nice but I will say one thing, Warframe even after four years of playing it. Been playing since open beta literally as soon as it popped up.  I still enjoy the game, even if the grind is rather immense. You must grind quite literally for everything and I do mean everything.  New Frame, grind.  New Weapon, grind.  New Resource you need, grind.  Need Experience, grind.  This shouldn't put you off. There are some good well a lot for the most part.  The graphics are really stunning, the lore is coming together and turning out rather good. Unlike Blizzard the lore remains the same.  Several hidden things, like Oro-Kitty statues.  The clans are good as long as they remain active. You can actually make some good friends here.  About the Devs, I'm fairly sure their attitudes reflect the hate they receive daily. They can sometimes do kneejerk reactions which always open the floodgate. But they are human, so it's expected.  Now events aren't as great as they used to be. If they release a weapon in the event, it'll show up in Sorties eventually. Sorties are for those that enjoy pain, they start out as level 100's.  They've introduced some interesting things over the years.  They have done some unfortunate things, but nobody's perfect.  In short, it's a grindfest of a game, but it is still rather good. Enjoy it but don't burn yourself out as I have.  See you within the Origin System, Tenno. -End of Line-",Recommended,2017.04.11,6.0

I think a big part of me enjoying the game again is avoiding all the drama and not watching dev streams.  It's free to play. There will be grind. They need to make it slightly annoying to get stuff for free so there will be a reason to spend money.  With a bit of a grind, you can easily make a few hundred plat from trading no problem. Just hop in random relic matches and use whatever keys you have.  Veteran players generally want to help lower ranks, and I personally don't mind if a lower rank glues themselves to me in a mission in order to stay alive.  Practice, keep up, and get gud. Watch trade chat to see what's going for good plat, work for those things and then sell them.

Warframe,DoktorWieg,"Ninjas play free and slay gleefully""  Warframe is the pet project of Digital Extreme, the canadian development team that has been behind the Unreal series, Bioshock and The Darkness 2 (along with Homefront which was still a good game overall despite its many flaws). A cooperative third person shooter with impressive visuals and art style, refined parkour and mobility options as well as an interesting take on sci-fi, it is one of the most active, successful and evolving game on the F2P market.  Set in the far future of the darkSector universe, the solar system is now in a constant war between the conquering Grineer and the merchant guilds of the Corpus while also brushing off the Infested, remnants of a bio-weapon from the past. In this age of conflict, An order of warriors who were thought to have disappeared come back at the request of an entity known only as the Lotus. The Tenno are awakened from their slumber anew, their powers only matched by their mastery of the Warframes   Free to Play or Pay to Win?  Being a free to play title, this question will always come at the forefront of people's mind. Put simply, let's take in consideration what ""Pay to Win"" entails : the term signifies that a game allows paying customers to gain power that is greater than non-paying customers with no option for the non-paying customers to match this power equitably.  Warframe does not, in fact, allow paying customers to gain such power. In fact, most of the exclusively paying content of Warframe lies in cosmetics alternatives like skins, color sets, accessories and such. While you 'can' purchase some weapons, Warframe and such with platinum (the paid currency in the game), these are also obtainable through seeking out the equipment's blueprints and parts then crafting them into the desired items.  Even more so, many of the Prime equipment (more embellished version of the regular gear) cannot be bought outright except outside of a Prime Access offer which allows paying customers to gain a set of gear corresponding to the most recent Prime Warframe released. Even so, the difference lies that those who purchase a Prime Access do get a few cosmetics atop of the already obtainable Warframe and weapons through regular play.  Moreover, the Platinum currency is often used in ingame trading between players as the mean to buy Prime equipment part blueprints and other such tradeable ressources. Thus, the Warframe economy works on a supply and demand system where gaining rare parts and mods (more about this later) can be then be exchanged to other players in order to gain Platinum without personally spending money.    Firstly, Warframe is a constantly evolving game that has been nearly three years running. The game that it was in closed beta (where I got the first chance to play) has changed so very much that many that returns to the game today find it an almost completely different experience. From the game being now more approachable to having added many features that the community suggested to even revamping entire systems already in place for others that expand the gameplay greatly :                As a free to play game, there is the required incentive for players to pay for things they could get for free by playing, aka a ""time wall"". For one, crafting of most weapons and Warframes isn't instantaneous and usually can be counted in hours and, in case of an entire Warframe build, days (aka 12 hours per part, which can be done simultaneously, then a 3 day build for the final combination of the parts into a Warframe). Along these are some of the few points that might vary depending on the player's opinion on them :           Warframe will appeal to those who wish to play a shooter with satisfying firearm and melee combat mechanics, flashy powers that are varied and unique to every Warframe. While the loot drops and slight grindiness can be a turn off, it is often offset by just how the gameplay feels fluid and intuitive to get into.",Recommended,2016.03.05,2.0

Warframe,MythlyInari,"Warframe.  Oh boy.   Warframe's not a typical MMO. It's a squad based third person shooter set in the FAR future. You, the player, are of the Tenno faction, commanding Warframes under the guideance of the Lotus. Aka: Space Mom. The other factions of the game, which can be your ally one moment, foe the next, are the cloned disasters Grineer, with their levels and design of armor and weapons designed around metal and machinery. Their goal is to one day find a cure for their species, which rapidly degrade due to the cloning process. The Corpus, their rival faction, is all about tech and greed. They're smart. Sly. Always send robots to do their jobs. Credits (the in game currency) are their first and last prize, hardly joining in commadery. Dominating the market, even joining all sides of a war to make trade while at war with them is their buisness. The Orokin, The Infested, and The Sentients...well, they're secretive, bizzare, and supposedly long gone.  Unlike a lot of F2P MMOs, their ""premium currency"" can be obtained through trading with other players. While the game can't be considered ""pay 2 win"" due to the extreme focus on Co-Op gameplay, it's diminished a little due to the existance of the Conclave, the PVP enviorment. It's completely reasonable to ignore this mode as, well, there's no forced reason apon one to play it. I for one tried a few rounds, and that's all. It's community is the complete opposite of Warframe's normal side. It's incredibly toxic, even in the team based PVP.  The normal parts of the game can get really chaotic. Your main goal in the game, really, can be many things. From hoarding every piece of equipment, right down to scanning everything in a massive lorehunt. Players are technically overpowered, and will pretty much always be this way. You're a metal ninja with stuff straight out of magic, defying the laws of gravity, even create Limbo in a area!  The combat's pretty fun. If you're a fan of being moble, you're going to love this game. Even if you play Rhino, the typical tank ""Frame"" (playable character) can still run on walls, hop up walls, hang onto them, superjump, even have mid-air bullettime! Later levels and planets in the game can get absolutely insane with the number of mobs from the many factions. Nothing ever feels as good as firing two rounds of a shotgun with radiated fire bullets and have it's ultimate skill send off a AOE that melts away armor and just makes everything explode. Loot flying everywhere!  There's a problem with the loot, though, that can push people away. It's timed. Weapons can take from several hours to a full day to craft. On top of this, you need to farm for materials to craft them to begin with. Platnium can come in to speed up the process, so it has the feeling of the typical, bad facebook game. ESPECIALLY when it comes to the THREE day wait on new frames once you've finished the parts. If anything, you should save platnium for these times.  Thankfully, this game doesn't force any kind of ""Membership"" status down your throat. There's no levels in the game locked off with money. Only in your skill and equipment, clearing level after level to unlock the planets you need.  The enviorments, I feel, have the most love out of anything else in the game. Lush forests overtaking machinery, outer space filled with astroid and ship debree, underwater combat, infected ships and planets...Deserts, snowy reigons..There's a lot to see, here.  The game also doesn't take too much to actually play. I can't play Fallout 4, I can just barely play Injustice, but I can easilly run this game on around medium settings.  Beware, the game IS a grind. If you have time, you will be having that time spent farming and fighting. RNG can bless you, or hate you as you try to grind for the same item for weeks.

The Warframe not only change the appearance of your character, but activate specific skill such as enabling stealth attacks, rather than providing armor thicker than usual and so on. The user then accesses to further customizations to buy with credits earned in each mission completed successfully. These enhance the efficiency of its Warframe but not only. There are in fact many consumable items to carry around for the later missions, useful to address the weaknesses of its configuration and style of play.",Recommended,2015.05.11,224.9

Warframe,CV Specialist,"Warframe is an online Multiplayer game that consists of different ""Warframes"" each with different and unique abilities. Starting Warframe for the very first time can be daunting and somewhat overwhelming especially inserting mods into warframes, weapons or simply crafting items. The game offers very little guidance for new players and often have to use YouTube to guide them.  The gameplay is fun , unique, fluid and fast paced. This makes it extremely satisfying for players to traverse the maps. The game requires alot of grind to craft items, gather loot and level up to become a ultimately stronger player. This process is fun but also tiresome especially without friends. Each Warframes unique and different abilities allow for various playstyles. In essence , the game is premised around becoming a better player, with the use of acquiring rare mods and weapons.  The game offers a trading system where blueprints of warframes, weapons and mods can be traded with other players . The currency known as ""platinum"" can be purchased with real life money or simply ""farmed"" and sold in turn for platinum. Its by no means a requirement to spend money in order to benefit .  The road to becoming a warframe-expert can be time consuming, however its fun and offers plenty content to explore and enjoy. Most of all the developers of this game continue to provide content on a regular basis to grow its fan base even bigger ! Highly Recommend  Pros: -Fast and fluid gameplay -Unique and offers a variety of playstyles for all player types -Very rewarding to players who put time into the game.  Cons: -Steep Learning Curve, game doesnt offer much guidance -Can be time consuming, sometimes feels too tedious",Recommended,2021.01.02,2.0

Warframe,[DFB] Shadur,"Warframe is a straightforward game at heart.  You're a Magic Cyborg Ninja Mercenary (IN SPACE!); you take on missions to get experience and stuff to make better gear.  That's the premise Digital Extremes started out with almost a decade ago of this writing, and it's still the core gameplay, but over time they have added ever shinier loot, prettier environments to magic cyborg ninja your way through, and wound up weaving an intriguing world around it.  The game itself is entirely free to play; anything that isn't cosmetics or a so-called 'booster' (which temporarily increases the XP, money or loot drop rate while playing) can be unlocked or obtained by playing the game; at worst, you trade money for time, spending the one you have in abundance to save the one you don't.  Missions can be played in public pick-up groups, or with a private invite-only group, or solo; the Warframe community remains one of the nicest online communities I'm proud to call myself part of.  If third-person co-op sci-fi shooters are your thing at all, this one comes highly recommended.",Recommended,2022.03.26,2.0

Warframe,Orca ☸ Bassem,"Yeah, it's got a lot of grinding. I hate grinding. But DAMN do I love this game. Almost 1,500 hours on record. The gameplay is so buttery smooth, the gunplay so tight and fun, the melee slick and gory, the parkour and jumping and sliding and gliding and backflipping, all of these merge into an incredibly fun experience that keeps me coming back even after months of hiatus.  It's also a rather generous game in terms of free-to-play. Few things are locked behind a paywall - most can be obtained if you are patient enough. And you can get currency by trading items with other players. It's very fair and logical, even if it takes time.  This is the only free-to-play game I've invested substantial amounts of money into, and I don't regret it at all. They keep adding stuff and improving things. Not just more items to grind (although there are plenty of those) but I'm talking new maps, game modes, refinements to mechanics like melee and stuff, even entire sub-games in the game (do you like Strike Suit Zero space combat? cause you can do that in Warframe now.)  There are dozens, hundreds of ways you can customise your loadout and play style, from your choice of suit (warframe) and its abilities to your main, secondary and melee weapons, to the attributes of all those, and more and more details.  The graphics are gorgeous, the music and sound effects excellent, and the gameplay, oh man. Like butter.  Take a look at the other Steam reviews.

It contains an ever expanding arsenal of weapons, mods, and warframes that can be mixed and matched for endless possible combinations. The game also features a highly satisfying clan system including the ability to build your own clan hall, which provides several bonuses besides the simple meeting area with cosmetics. And the great feature of Warframe is that it always contains a challenge. From raiding the Orokin towers, to hunting down the elusive Stalker and Harvester, something is there to put your mettle to the test. And in case it wasn't clear, you play as freakin' Space Ninjas. What's not to love?",Recommended,2014.01.27,448.4
Warframe,Harmania,"Warframe is a squad based third person shooter with RPG and brawler mechanics where you play as a psychic space ninja known as a ""Tenno"", which is an oddly adorable and not fittingly threatening name for a species which exists purely to create psychic space ninjas to commit genocide as a day job.  The game itself is free to play, and it means it. While there's a cash shop, you can buy almost everything in it with in-game credits if you're willing to do a light bit of grinding. For everything that isn't purchasable with in-game currency, you can farm in-game for the cash shop currency. Grinding is very important in Warframe. Effectively, if you wish to obtain new weapons, ""Frames"", or the like, you can either pay for it with the cash shop currency, or gather the materials from playing missions, pay a fee of in-game currency, then wait a few hours or days--real time, regardless of whether or not you're online--for it to finish. That said, the loot system is surprisingly fair, and it doesn't take much time to start building an arsenal of weapons and Warframes to play around with.  The storyline is fairly basic, but servicable. It's just tangible enough to help develop immersion, and that's all it attempts to do, assuming you don't think too hard about how a character can be your mortal enemy, but also simultaniously a bisected reanimated corpse, and a power hungry commander that's never seen you before.  Warframe would be relatively forgettable if it didn't have its incredibly rewarding, surprisingly in depth combat system. You have access to a wide variety of weapons ranging from high tech railguns to a whip made from the spine of a feral beast coated in lethal parasitic growths. Melee combat is deep enough to stand on its own, with a variety of weapon classes, fighting styles, combos, and the built in 'mod' system which allows you to customize the your Warframe, firearms and melee weapons. Most mods are fairly generic, offering things like increased reload speed, or higher damage. However, some are more interesting, being able to change the functionality of your abilities, or, say, allowing you to replenish your ""energy"" when taking health damage, which adds a considerable difference to playstyle.  You have your standard parkour system with wall running, slides, cliff hanging, flips, rolls, and the like, which combined with the weaponry, and the individual abilities of each frame, results in incredibly engaging, immersive combat that supports a wide variety of playstyles.  Altogether, if you're looking for a third person shooter MMO with incredibly strong gameplay, and a fairly pleasant aesthetic, and don't mind a bit of repetitive grinding, I recommend giving Warframe a try.",Recommended,2015.03.12,1.0

Warframe,Pocahawtness,"Warframe is a PVE COOP ( with some PVP end-game ) that has a striking resemblance to Borderlands... even down to the music. I don't know which came first but too many similarities to think that they were developed completely independently. The most notable difference is that Warframe has a series of very large maps and is not open-world. In Warframe you have a home-base, your spaceship, you mount expeditions to the various maps, selecting appropriate gear for the mission in hand.  The basic idea behind Warframe is that you have a battle suit called a warframe that comes with various skills. You can own many different Warframes and weapons, with which you can undertake missions to gather materials, designs and points to work your way up to the best equipment and skills.  The crafting is central to Warframe and is excellent. You can buy all the gear but it's much better to craft it all. It's easy to understand, and very well designed indeed, most importantly there isn't the slightest sign of RNG anywhere in the craftng. Thank heaven! Sure, drops are RNG, but you would expect that.  Levelling up has been very well designed. You, the player, levels but all your gear levels up too ~ each individual item has a level. Literally everything can be upgraded and tweaked. Even mods can be upgraded. When you get new gear that has to be levelled up, but the game has been designed in such a way that it's not as difficult as it may sound to level up a new gun for example. If you take along a level 1 item to a higher level conflict, it will level up fast.  The really clever part of Warframe is that the gear you make never goes obsolete. Gear comes in a myriad of different or flavours ( different skills of it's own, if you like ) and that's what drives you to collect more, but once you have some gear it isn't actually essential to get more. You just upgrade and mod it until it's as good as it can be, then it remains with you for life, so to speak. Sure there is some gear that is better towards the end-game, but if you really want to stick to your favourite gun then you can. The really important part of Warframs is building up a solid collection of mods for your gear. The mods are transferable and can change a basic weapon in to a super powerd end-game weapon. Most of your time will be spent trying to get good mods and upgrading them in to great mods.  You carry a primary gun, secondary gun, and a melee weapon. Melee figures highly in the game, but you can choose your own path. If you want to ignore melee, you can. If you want to go full ninja using swords and so on, you can. It's up to you. Although there are different formats for the missions, if you think of a combination of Borderlands and L4D then you won't go too far wrong. There are slower missions that you can solo and pace, but the moment you enter a party then it's going to be really fast.  Comparing it to Borderlands, the balance of the game is far better. You always feel that you are challenged, but you always feel that your weapons are doing what they should do.  The social aspect of the game is weak, actually very similar to Borderlands. As yet I haven't seen any elitism, which is refreshing. People just form parties and get on with it, without moaning that player isn't performing or whatever. Teamplay tends to be very poor, but that's actually very typical for a coop. The average young lad is more interested in Rambo'ing a level rather than doing what he should be doing ~ acting as part of a team, so many players are primarily built for DPS and speed.  Warframes take a unique perspective on gender, given their context within the storyline. You are a Tenno, an ancient warrior, and you own and use a series of Warframes that have different abilities and features. Oddly, warframes are gender locked, so as you choose different warframes for different missions so your gender will alternate. How strange is that?! Of course you can just stick to one warframe if you prefer, but that's really not the point of the game.  The main quests in the game are good, but the in-game explanations are very poor. You often find yourself completely baffled as to what's going on. You will need to reference youtube for many of the quests just in an attempt to understand what you are supposed to be doing. Missions ( small quests! ) are much simpler and really don't need any explanation at all. You just see them light up on the Starchart when you should run them, and you click and go. There's also a constant supply of Alert Missions that give bonus rewards. All in all, there is a lot to do.  The only one real criticism I have found is that in two solo quests it locks you in the quest until you have won. You can not leave, you can not bypass, you have to win or it's literally game over. You can't get out by dying. There is no ""stuck"" key. Restart your PC and you will be back in the quest with no way out. You can't get help from friends. You can't progress the game at all until you win. To my mind that is utter insanity. So many players will have reached one of those points and just thrown in the towel. There isn't really much warning either ~ you could well have a useless warframe on when you reach the point and it's really game over. Seems strange on an mmo that you want to get rid of customers. Really, total nonsense.Thank heaven there are only two points like that. The only thing I can say is if ever it says that you are about to have restricted access to the rest of the game, immediately check youtube to find out what you are in for, get your best gear on, and just hope, because it may be the end of the game for you.  Party games operate exactly the same as Borderlands. There is no server as such, rather the person who starts the party, hosts the party. This means that generally pings are very good, but can vary depending how far you are from the host - and what type of connection they have. In general, though, the gameplay is not particularly ping dependant.  The gameplay is not structured so that you require tanks and healers and so on although they do exist. The developers could do with making players depend on the team more, to lessen the Rambo behaviour in the game.  The game is free, but of course it constantly ( and I really mean CONSTANTLY! ) tempts you to spend real money. The game is definitely not P2W or P2P, but it most certainly is more fun if you spend a little. Most items can be crafted, but of course some of the exclusive skins will cost you money. There are three currencies in the game: credits, earnt by playing; platinum, bought for cash; and finally cash. The advantage of platinum is that it can be traded between players, so some exclusive items can be obtained by trading. However, cash can not be traded so if you want the really exclusive skins then there is little option but to part with hard earned cash.  Although players can trade there is no in-game player market. The only market in the game is for players to buy items from the game which are sold at fixed cash prices, platinum ( tradeable currency in the game ) and credits you earn playing. Taxation can also be very high on traded items.  Ultimately, the downfall ( the reason you may stop playing the game ) is the lack of variation in missions and the lack of true coop play. If you like speed play and are part of a static you could keep going forever on this game, but otherwise you are likely to get bored sooner or later. Don't think for an instant that it's not worth playing though, it most certainly is!  I've been on the lookout for a Borderlands type mmo for a very long time. Shame I didn't know there was one already out there. Stop wasting time. Download it! It's an amazing game.",Recommended,2016.12.20,859.8

The Good: - Gameplay is fast, and satisfying. - Actually free to play, because you can sell duplicate items for real-money currency to other players. The only things you cannot get for free are community-made cosmetics, which are sold through the Steam store, and a cut of the sale is given to the community member that made it. - Play the story at your own pace. There is no FOMO as events come back yearly, exclusive items can still be obtained via various means.  The bad: - Hard to get into the game due to the sheer amount of content and things to do.

Warframe,Lucy,"Warframe is the best truly F2P looter shooter on the market. New players will find a massive amount of content released over the years. Warframe suffers from the same issue most live service games suffer, and that is that the core gameplay loop is sometimes neglected for an extedned amount of time while more focus is put on shiny new content.  As a long time player of Warframe you'll find that there is a lack of a true endgame and updates feel small and meaningless for the most part. But for new players, this is not an issue.  Covid has definetly affected the game studios capabilities and communications quite drasticly but it seems like it's going in a better direction. Game updates in general range from ""Who asked for this?"" to ""this is pretty damn cool"".  In conclusion, Warframe is a great game to get into as a new player and even as a veteran i can't complain as i have over 4800 hours put in and still log in from time to time and keep up with the new stuff on the horizon.",Recommended,2021.04.20,5.0

I've been given numerous items from MR 20-26 players--weapons, rare mods, a complete set of a Nova Prime--for free).  Most of them also wouldn't mind helping you on missions you find difficult, if you'd just ask. Almost to the point where they're eager, really. There was a time where I kept failing this one assassination mission, then a vet joined in, stomped the boss and asked how long I have been playing. Told him I was new, guy then played with me for a while, told me what things I should look for first and where to farm them, etc. I asked very basic questions, but he answered all of them.

Warframe,Tony,I didn't hear about this game up until I heard about the release of Destiny 2 and people really gave this game a recommendation if you wanted to play something similar.  At first I thought that it would probably be bad since it's free to play and released in 2013 but no I was surprised on how wrong I was. The graphics are still amazing to this day and the developers keep updating the game constantly so you'll almost never run out of things to do.  It's a really grind game which I really enjoy playing.  If you don't have the money to buy Destiny or similar games I would really recommend this one and you would be surprised that you might actually enjoy this one more than you would with the other games.  Of course there are things you can buy in game to make you unlock everything faster but that almost destroys the fun for me so I enjoy playing without spending any money. The developers has to earn money some way and it's a nice element to the game if you want to support them.  I am still shocked on how much content there is for a free to play game.

Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn its simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist.

Warframe,⭐Spoiler Quinn⭐,"Warframe, oh boy Warframe... One of the better free to play games I'd say.  Really fun, addictive gameplay (4 vs 100 pve enemies basically lol) and it really takes you down a power trip. Said gameplay makes the absolute grind that this game can be fun. Enough variety in mission tiles, the story (after a certain quest) gets impressively unique!  Normally I don't talk about the music but my god, this game has some pretty tunes (We All Lift Together has to be my favorite), it really helps set the vibe for the quests!  Now let's talk about the microtransactions, since a free game nowadays can't be complete without those lol (I don't blame developers though, they need to make revenue one way or the other! Just some people abuse this system and it makes the others look extremely bad. LOOKING AT YOU DIABLO IMMORTAL). Warframe has the best microtransactions system I've seen, with the premium currency (the platinum) being able to be exchanged in the market for parts other people can sell to you, making the premium currency accessible to fully F2P players with the downside that you need to find people to sell these things to (The website Warframe Market works perfectly for this!), so as long as you have prime parts, mods or some ayatan sculptures you can always get PL without paying for it, and I think that's really, really good. Some things I'd say are overpriced (like Octavia's musical tones like jesus christ why are those worth 50 platinum) but overall I'd say Warframe handles its microtransaction system perfectly.  Funny how I've talked about the micros more than the actual gameplay lol, but it had to be said, I love this game and I love its way to handle microtransactions.",Recommended,2022.06.21,372.1
Warframe,Kernalgohd,"Reasons to play warframe; -To feel like an awesome ninja -To feel like an awesome robot -To feel like an awesome martial artist -To feel like an awesome marksman -To feel like an awesome archer -To feel like an awesome swordsman -To feel like an awesome mercenary -To drown in content updates  Pretty sure the dev team has ADHD or something, my goodness, they cant sit still for a minute. Most companies are down for sitting around on their latest update like ""Yeah we did a good job"" Meanwhile at warframe HQ the dev team is like ""DONE THIS UPDATE, GOTTA MAKE A NEW ONE, GO GO GO""  The game feels so good, plays smooth as (shaved) balls. Everything feels good to do, and even if it bugs out a bit, its generally entertaining to some degree (EG. flying off walls at hyperspeed)  Downsides? Honestly not many, Im sure computer strength can be a major issue, but its fairly good for the most part, mid grade computers should be fine at like 20 fps on reasonable settings. While it is possible to play this game free, and nearly everything is obtainable without paying (even many cosmetic stuff) It does take quite a long time. The further you get in the game and the more time you invest, the less this becomes a problem. Anyways, it is VERY easy to spend WAY too much on this game, Im sure Ive spent hundreds on this (yes yes, I feel the shame). Also, inventory slots are platinum manditory, however you can get platinum from others in game, selling recipes for stuff like formas and such. You will need inventory slots if you want to have more than a small handful of warframes at your disposal at one time, or weaponry.

Warframe,[nbn] Ray,"Were you a weeb kid? Do you want to be a psychic ninja zombie robot?  This game's really well-optimized. If you can play 3D games at all and online games at all, you can probably run this on the lowest settings. It's high-action co-op PVE squad for various mission types, sometimes tied to stories, with extreme flexibility for developing on individual playstyle.  They're still working on the intro for getting going in the game. It's a little confusing at first. I still wouldn't trade what DE and the game do for community and cooperative spirit away for anything.  As you start to get into the story missions, it gets increasingly cinematic and engaging. It has some of the best lore, locations, and NPCs I've ever dealt with in an online game, and it's insanely well-maintained as well as constantly updated.  Community engagement has shaped these constant updates, and it shows.  The customization is fun and engaging. It's sincerely possible to do anything you want in the game without spending on in-game currency-- the only thing you can't farm and player trade up toward are skins that are dollar costs because they're approved fan artist skins and the original artist is getting paid.  Overall, I highly recommend Warframe.",Recommended,2020.01.19,735.0

Warframe,Cassynder,"Warframe is a game that I've played on and off for over five years, which is almost a recommendation by itself. Free-to-play, it offers a staggering amount of content and doesn't force egregious micro-transactions on you every step of the way. You can play a good portion of the game without having to pay anything, although most weapons, Warframes and the like take considerable time to build. Which can be sped up with Platinum, the in-game currency. Don't ever do that, just wait it out. Where I feel money needs to be spent is on slots for weapons, Warframes and such. If you are the type to collect vast armouries, like I am, you'll either have to pay or trade for Platinum. By that stage you'll most likely have already decided for yourself if you want to continue playing or not and trust me, if you decide to stay, a bundle of Platinum to buy slots for your gear is more than fair for the content on offer here. Wait for a sale on Platinum and you'll be good to go.  With that out of the way, what is Warframe? It's a looter shooter, and a damn good one at that. Perfect for gunning down fools in a couple missions or in chunks of hours, Warframe is a good time all round. And it's fun. The best way I can sell it is to say that you are a space ninja, you run around in a bunch of suits called Warframes with a collection of swords, guns, knives and lots more to kill things. In style. Each Frame has its own set of powers that complement your weaponry and you run a variety of different mission types against three main factions: the Grineer, Corpus and Infested. Space nazi's, corporate jackasses and space zombies, respectively. There's a story sprinkled in there, which really comes into its own further on into your experience from Second Dream onwards, and it has an interesting universe to explore. If that sounds like your kind of deal, go get 'em, tiger! It's free-to-play, after all.  Warframe can be overwhelming at times, although it's gotten better for new players in recent years. My advice? Don't bother about everything at once. Focus on the little things. Find a weapon you like, a favourite Frame that suits your playstyle and work your way through the game. Or play with friends, or join a clan, who can help you out. The whole game can even played solo, if like me you are a lone wolf. The impressive thing about this game is that there's almost like different games within the game. You can focus on leveling up gear and building new Frames, also running the missions to fund that. There's the clan side of the game, where you can drop a tonne of resources, credits and building a Dojo your mamma will be proud of, as well as getting more blueprints for more stuff. You can throw your lot in with certain factions and run special mission for them to curry more favour with them, opening relics and running void rift missions to get special Prime gear....there's a lot here for you if you want to go down this particular rabbit hole. And that's just scratching the surface.  There are some downsides to note, however. I've not been through the new player experience recently but the game can be confusing to start with. What's the point? Why am I running these missions? What am I supposed to be doing? It's an open game and this works against it at times. It can also be repetitive to run similar missions again and again, gunning and slicing your way through the hordes of fodder between you and your objective. The worst offender is the lack of documentation on a lot of the game. Where do certain parts drop? What's the best damage types for each faction? Where to find some of the new Warframes? The Warframe Wiki is your friend, but the game should really be doing a lot of that for you.  If you are after a shooter with a lot of content and a bunch of weapons and different ""classes"" to play with, than you won't go wrong with Warframe. It has flaws, every game does, but it's a free game and it doesn't hurt to try it out.

This game's update cycle has been a journey, from a very basic third person shooter with rudimentary and tacked on parkour to this fast paced, frantic off the walls looter shooter, it has been a very interesting ride. DE keeps this game updated frequently, one of the reasons why so many people stay, and are always trying to pump new life into this game.  Two issues you might want to be aware of before you play: The new player experience is really dull, you start with mostly crap gear, barely any money or resources and it will take you quite a while to get anywhere in this game without friends, especially without friends who have been playing for a long time as they can hook you up with some good mods and some plat(Platinum, the game's premium currency) to get yourself going. The last one, at least for me, is that this game can cause some serious burnout as this game is very farmy, you will spend HOURS doing the same missions over and over and over again just to get one blueprint, or one component, or to farm a specific resource and that can wear down on you pretty hard after a while.  With all that said though, the best way to learn about this game is to try it for yourself as a picture is worth 1000 words, the game is free so all you're losing is time.

Warframe is a free-to-play online third person shooter where you take control of what I can only describe as ""remote controlled zombie cyborg ninjas with super powers"", because that's basically what Warframes are. And they are all amazing. It's entirely PvE (except for a very small subsection of PvP that is hardly ever played), so the game is all about killing hordes upon hordes of enemies and to get loot. And the movement mechanics, the shooting mechanics, the CQB mechanics all feel incredibly refined and make you feel like a bonafide badass at any point in time.  And while it can at times feel grindy, especially if you're looking for that one special mod or weapon part that you really need to complete a build, the gameplay loop feels satisfying enough that you won't get completely bored of it, and makes you want to try just one more time, or just one more time again.

I enjoy the game, but I'm only able to get the most out of it because I began playing years ago, and the new player experience has been saddled with a larger and larger backlog over time. Helping friends get into the game, I can really see the kind of monotonous grind that is expected of them, and it's daunting.  If you have the patience to progress through the game and seek external advice such as fan wikis, Warframe will offer you a satisfying experience with many goals to grind for. But you will need a lot of time to get there, and the game will certainly be offering premium purchases during that time.  In the previous versions of my review, I also talked about my gripes surrounding the story. While I found older content to be very cohesive, some parts of the game's newer content are very grating to me, personally. Many elements feel like an ""IOU"" of writing, introducing new terms and inventions which you have never been told the origin of. Some of the confusion is definitely intended in order to add mystery, but other points feel as if introductions were skipped in a shallow attempt to force unfamiliarity. That being said, not every part of the story is an offender. I enjoyed the new 1999 content, which still deals with abstract concepts, but which is much more grounded with an appealing cast of characters.",Recommended,2023.12.16,2.0

Warframe,Dataflow,"It's space ninjas performing flashy gymnastics and gaudy movements, who would say no to that?  On top of that the community is helpful and friendly. On PC you'll always find PUGs to run missions with, and other players will not care if you are MR1 (player level) or if you are using the initial default frame (class). There's almost no way to be a hindrance when grouping up with other randoms (unless you go AFK or something) because the missions are quick and straightforward.  The game respects your time and will not demand your attention (or money) any more than what you are willing to give. You will not miss out on new content or become so far behind that players wouldn't want to group up with you. Unlike other popular games in the genre, fear of missing out is not a common theme here; All content (past and present) is included for free and can be obtained in-game at your own leisure.  While the grind is long and endless, you can make meaningful progress whether you play for 15 minutes or 10 hours. Where other games demand that you keep playing (or spend cash) to have the slightest chance of witnessing the rest of the game, Warframe has no such tradeoffs and playing it in short bursts at your own pace is perfectly fine regardless of rank or level.  The devs, a bunch of goofy Canadians, are in constant communication with the players; They stream several times a week with nice loot drops, host drunk dev streams every couple of months (with no shortage of lewd jokes and innuendos), and are actually likable and funny.  There are two main things setting this game back and limiting its full potential:  - The omission of competitive PvP to cater to the hardcore audience - Lack of cross-save functionality  Alas, there's no clear confirmation whether the devs will eventually make those things happen or not.  Overall, Warframe is a great example of how to do F2P right.",Recommended,2021.05.04,98.3

Warframe,lumi,"This game really blew me away when I tried it this November. I never expected a Free to Play experience to be this rewarding and fair. You don't have to spend anything to progress as everything is unlockable, and tradeable. Obtaining the premium Platinum currency with trading isn't much of a hassle later on too!  The story picks up HARD mid-game, that's when I really started getting attached to this game, it was a really amazing experience and I'm upset I haven't tried it sooner. I've always heard of this game via word of mouth, but I never gave it a shot or even looked into it. I think this is a game everyone should atleast give a try, this is how Free to Play SHOULD be.",Recommended,2024.12.29,237.6
Warframe,Krasnoya Ronin,"Product received for free  My main account is on Playstation, but I started a PC account to go through the The New War expansion storyline, and as a challenge for using only Excalibur, my favorite Warframe.  It has a solid and interesting (if not sometimes confusing) story, with only a few hiccups for progression (Mastery Rank requirements for the Star Chart and obtaining a Necramech without paying real money were both frustrating and took a number of days to complete). It's still really good though, even if you aren't into ""games as a service.""  My advice for new players who find they enjoy this game is to do everything you can to get through the story as soon as each element unlocks. You get some incredible story rewards that you can use for other parts of the game that will make things much easier if you decide to become a collector or completionist. Also, if you're not a weird nerd like me and want to try other warframes than the one you start with, save your starter Platinum currency for warframe and weapon slots. Yeah, that's a thing. If you just wanna run with your starter (which is absolutely possible), then you don't have to worry about this so much. But c'mon, who's gonna do that?  As for the Free-to-Play nature of the game, Warframe is also excellent imo. There are various methods of monetization, but the only things you can't get without paying up are purely cosmetic. Everything else you can get for free if you're patient and don't mind grinding. There's even some stuff you can ONLY get through playing, which is neat. You can also obtain premium currency by trading with other players, but I admit that is pretty time consuming. Just know that if you play a lot like me you naturally will get a lot of mods or prime parts to sell just through the course of running missions.",Recommended,2021.12.26,912.3

Warframe,jack,"Gotta agree with @PotatoGamer100's review (in most helpful). I just got back into Warframe having not played since the Archwing update and I really have to admit that DE has been absurdly busy and it seems they've been listening to fans and players and implementing solutions to problems in creative, non-destructive ways.  One of the biggest criticisms of Warframe you used to see was that it was too grindy, as most MMOs are. From the old Void and reward table system to this new relic one, I see a MASSIVE improvement in rewards and less reliability in off-site resources to be able to get what you're looking for. Not to mention improvements to trading and communication... Warframe really has tackled many of its issues and the developers don't seem to be afraid to rethink things and go outside the box.  Granted, I've only just recently gotten back into it, I'm still very impressed with how far it's come and how much has been added. I almost felt like a new player again upon my return, that's how much was changed yet all of the new additions were intuitive and by the end of it, I felt better about where the game is now compared to where it was when I stopped playing.  For a game that's FREE and not pay-to-win, you really cannot go wrong. Refer to PotatoGamer100's review for a more in-depth coverage of the mentality some players lack on the game (being creative as opposed to materialistic).",Recommended,2017.03.08,2.0

Warframe,Steel,"For a free game, I had a lot of fun playing this. It's better than I thought it would be.  The Gameplay is great. It plays quite well, even with a Steam Controller. The Parkour, while feeling kind of limited, it makes you feel like a badass. Now mixing Parkour with a Third-Person Perspective, and you are in for something epic, gory, and fun that is free. If you though that Black Ops III's Parkour was fun (which is not imo), think again.  Things called ""Mods"" lets you customize the strengths of your weapons, which makes combat much more easier on higher rank enemies. A lot of levels and worlds to check out. You name it.  The game does have some flaws, though. Using my Steam Controller on some menus are unpolished. I couldn't get out of a Success Screen, even though I was pressing B. When selecting a level, you want members to play with you, right? It shows that pressing ""X"" will make it so you wait for some people, but it turns out you have to press ""A"" twice on the level you want to do in order to wait. Yah...

Warframe,AngelDust,"Alrighty, so I rarely leave reviews, but quite frankly, at this point I feel like I should. Ive poured my soul into this game and its been a fantastic run. This game has outstanding graphics and the optimization is solid. The gameplay and the in-game movement and parkour is a really fun addition to the game and really makes the game fast paced (at most times; the game still does have its dull moments). For a free to play game, youre getting so much gameplay and you can really pour some serious time into this game (currently at 1,804 hours atm). The game isnt without its flaws though. There are a few bugs that irritate the heck out of me such as mission waypoints bugging out and not displaying properly or the rare moments of falling through the map when deploying my K-Drive. Even with all the bugs though, I always find myself coming back to this game. The customization is also really something else. You have so many different options for skins, armor pieces and colors that you really can make your warframes stand out even amongst the same frames. The modding system (upgrade system) is also really extensive. If you really like a frame, you can mod it to the way you want to play so you can really excel at what you do. You can pretty much tune your frame to the way you want to play so theres so much freedom with making your builds. There's so much more I could say about this game but all im going to say is its definitely worth the time (and money) ive put into it. If youre on the fence on whether you should get it, give it a chance. Theres very little tutorial but if you find a helpful higher MR player thats willing to show you the ropes, give it some time. You will get it. You will want to join a clan early on for the extra tech that you get from being in one. Well, thats all i have to say for now. Good luck Tenno!",Recommended,2020.08.06,3.0

The game layout is simple to understand and the map is huge, with two open worlds to explore, both of which include a way to create and name your own weapons and modify them to your guns and melees to you own ideals. I honestly can not say a bad thing about this game, i first played on ps4 in early 2018 and fell in love with it straight away. the ranking system is easy to understand but is irrelevant as the game allows you opportunities to mod your weapons and warframe to play on higher levels for longer, not to mention a recruit channel to allow you to play in a squad of 4, which will most likely be a range of players with different abilities, weapons, mods, and skill sets to help aid you in your missions !!

For being a free to play it has very nice graphics, but of course it comes then with some market stuff, like buying money, starter packs and those kinda stuff. Saying that it takes a long while to level, to get money, and to be able to buy anything!  There is some customasation where you can change colors on yourself, as well as your weapons.  You seem to be able to craft different items, aswell as getting some kind of ""drone"" to follow you around, but I'm yet to experience that.

Warframe,PurpleXVI,"Warframe is a mediocre single-player experience, but a great multiplayer experience if you've got a consistent cast of friends to play with. For a free-to-play MMO, the grind is manageable and the stuff you can buy is always stuff you could always just grind for. There is no actual advantage to be gained by paying money, except for saving yourself a bit of time and grind. I believe literally the only thing that ONLY real money can buy is some cosmetics and more storage space if you're the sort of pack rat(like me) who won't even throw away a bad or mediocre piece of equipment because WHAT IF and also because it would leave unsatisfactory holes in the collection.  Gameplay-wise, Warframe has come a long way from its humble beginnings and now you actually FEEL like a badass space ninja with even the simplest movement combos and combat actions.  The soundtrack is excellent.  The visuals are stunning.  And the game sees constant updates. Buffs and reworks to stuff that doesn't work or has ended up being underpowered, constant introductions of new frames, new gear, new quests, new areas, etc.  If you haven't played for a year and then return, you'll have to learn half the game anew because they are CONSTANTLY upgrading and innovating. Warframe really has an extremely dedicated crew.  The storytelling is very love it or hate it. The people I know, myself included, fall sharply into one camp that rolls their eyes and makes wanking gestures while suffering through the story parts, and people who are breathlessly excited for the story parts. I'm in the latter camp, I think they execute the story excellently.  The only complaints I could make about parts that require a bit too much grinding is levelling up the Quills and Vox Solaris, but even that's been largely dealt with by subsequent updates if you don't mind doing a bit of research to see what the most effective approach is.",Recommended,2019.03.29,910.4

Community are so friendly, you join a clan and there's a high chance they'll donate you to give you a boost.  Characters or (""Frames"") have really unique design, not only that, there's tones of gameplays like stealth, dps, support, tank and speedrun. But you don't have to stick with one gameplay, because of something called modding. You can add mods and make up your own gameplay, enough said about that, you can also go fishing and mining or just exploring. YEP! It's also open world, not only that, the story mode is so dramatic and it really captures your thoughts.  You can also ride hover boards and fly on jetpack wings or archwings and you can drive space ships.

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. Thank you <3",Recommended,2023.01.31,39.6

We all agreed while it's great for a free to play game containing some beautiful graphical work, some interesting game mechanics, and good controller support, it gets tedious very quickly and nothing really makes it stand apart from a failed third-person action game like Too Human unfortunately. It's also quite a tough game to get a grip of as it contains lack of explaination about how certain aspects of upgrading and customising a character work.

Warframe,Nobody,"- After so many years since release, still one of the BEST FREE shooters around, except for the PvP part (which is not worth mentioning for this game). - Beautiful graphics, shinny lightning effects. - Unfortunately, it is not a massive multiplayer, you can play it only alone or co-op in the open world, while the missions are pretty much instanced. - The game has a very strong player base so if you don't have any friends online to have fun with, you will sure get strangers available anytime through the matchmaking system. - Warframe can literally offer you hundreds of hours of intensive gameplay, adrenaline rush and fun, solo or co-op. - It also has an interesting (though somehow short) personal story you must follow through to finish the challenges, quests, develop your character and access certain function and abilities for the playing character and for your own spaceship. - You can play the game without spending a dime. But if you want to have the best gear and weapons you must invest some. - It is funny that some players that spent thousands of hours in the game criticize it.

Warframe,☽ Tony ☾,"At first I thought that this is nothing but your casual third person shooter. You're given the enemy and you gotta put that bullet through their heads, but after actually trying it out my view completely changed. Warframe is more complex than you could imagine. You get to actually choose your own frame, ""character"", who comes with it's own special set of abilites, and apart from that, you have 3 groups of weapons you get to choose from for a wide experience, and a unique way to build and augument them to make them all stronger. The multitude of tasks and missions will surely keep you busy and entertained, and if farming is your specialty (get dem argon crystals, boys), even better! As much as the game may get repetitive, you have several quests to take care of, and soon you will discover the actual storyline going on behind that will end up getting you even more addicted; each one of these quests unlocking new features, such as having your own companions to aid you in battles. As I am a sucker for high quality graphics and detailed landscapes, Warframe left me breathless. From smooth, ship surfaces to rough asteroid tilesets and robotic designs, you will never get bored of looking around and telling yourself ""these graphics are totally slayin it"".  Long story short, if you wanna be a space ninja alien thingy, shoot and slash things, be bombarded with a ton of game lore for you to piece it together, see pretty things or just brag that you have the prettiest frame (fashionframe ftw), this F2P is definitely for you!

Warframe,Death,"This is honestly the most relaxing game I've ever played. Yeah there's thousands of micro transactions but everything you buy can be farmed or earned by daily rewards and any warframe or weapon bought can't be used in PvP which is a terrific modal for a game.  The combat system is very exciting and makes you feel like a ""ninja"" in the sense you're totally bad ass. Every warframe has their pros and cons and finding the best warframe that suites your play style is what makes this game insanely fun. I can never stick to the same warframe because each one has their uses in different situations. The mod system is a bit tricky at first and very overwhelming but a few hours researching and consulting chat will clear that up.  PS: You will most likely always have a google tab open your first month of playing. After years of playing I still have to google my builds and find the best farm locations for pretty much anything!

Warframe,13lack Talon,"Just wanted to add that 5 years later and I still find myself putting time towards warframe. Great job, Digital Extremes!  Warframe is a refreshing take on the squad based 3rd Person shooter, in its over all game play and especially its art design. While not every gamer's taste, I find Warframe to be a refreshing take on design. The characters and aliens are unique, very inspired and striking. My compliments to the art direction and the whole team. The gameplay is tight, responsive and franciticly exciting giving the player the experience of feeling like they're a true ""space ninja"". You'll be parkouring over obstacles, climbing on walls, hacking apart enemies and sliding across floors while going all ""John Woo"" on anyone that stands between your teams and your objective, Ninja.  I've found myself coming back to this game over and over again ever since a friend got me into it way back in June 13'. As of today, I've already spend hundreds of hours in Warframes. Game sessions can be as pick up and play as a half hour or turn into longer survival and raids.  Its one of the most open to all FTP's out there. Paying players don't overwhelm the F2P players in the gameplay department. They just don't have to spend the time gathering and crafting those items. All of which can be easily found in the game and created with miniumal grind time compared to how many other F2P's work. Digital Extremes really did this game right, give it a try and you won't be disappointed.",Recommended,2014.04.14,3.0

Warframe,Calick,"Oh, boy, where do I start with this gem...  Warframe is not just your average 3rd person action free-to-play game. It is also a growing, playable universe that is very easy to be fascinated by. Every year the team at Digital Extremes introduces a new game-changer that is the equivalent of a game sequel, and integrates it into the core game. The current Warframe is the result of over six years of non-stop hard work and a dedicated fanbase. When it premiered back in 2013 it was a simple action shooter based on quick matches about defeating hordes of enemies while completing different objectives. Now it's a compelling cinematic experience, it's got two open worlds (with a third one on the works), over 40 craftable characters to play as, daily and weekly challenges with endless rewards, a huge variety of enemies to dispose of, and an upcoming space battle game mode that will increase the scale of the game to never before seen levels. And the graphics keep getting improved over time. If you think this game looks old by today's standards, well, you are wrong.  As always, the coop element is crucial: nothing beats the experience of a full team of 4 space ninjas, each with their unique powers and weapons, wreaking havoc among hordes of unlucky enemies. Soon the squads will also be able to connect in real time to complete big scale objetives, like taking down an orbital enemy base.  It's very easy to get started with Warframe, but it takes a lot of time and dedication to master all of it. Most of that dedication translates into farming. Farming of xp points, resources, credits, mods, blueprints, etc. But the playable content has become so huge that you'll probably never feel the farming as tedious. And everytime you succeed at crafting a new weapon or Warframe, it is bloody satisfying ...  One of this game's major downsides is the chance that you'll feel overwhelmed by everything the game has to offer during your first hours on it. The answer to that, is that this game is all about community. Ask the players (there's a chat for it). Make friends. Learn from them. The game makes it very easy to communicate with people and find out what your next step should be. Communication is organic and never gets in the way of playing the game itself.  The game's story is also becoming more elaborate and epic as time goes by. There are MANY surprises along the way and what's in store for the future looks very promising. There's a particular revelation after many hours into the game that every gamer should experience, as it is truly incredible not just in terms of world-building, but also how it affects the perception of the whole game.  Long story short: if you got time on your hands and you're looking for the ultimate coop action experience, do not think twice and try Warframe. You can thank me later.  --Review was updated as of July 2019",Recommended,2016.11.25,3.0

Warframe,HUNbeaT,"Warframe is an awesome and very well made F2P game. The game captivated me from the first minute. The different combinations of weapons, warframes, companions as well as enemies, mod combinations, missions and content make the game exciting and challenging. Even after a longer break, you can easily find your way back and continue farming. It's also fun to play with friends. With ingame purchases you can gain advantages, but this is not necessary, since you can do the F2P as well. You only need to pay for cosmetic items or you want to have things in your possession now. The community is super friendly and nice.  Clear recommendation to play and enjoy.",Recommended,2023.01.22,798.3
Warframe,Vanta Black,"At first, I REALLY didnt like this game. I played it back in January of 2014 for a couple hours and felt utterly lost and confused on what was going on.  Fast forward to two days ago when a member of my clan started playing it out of the blue. Once again I reinstalled it and started from where I left my 'Mag' Warframe. Again, I was confused, lost and irritated along with my clansmen. So, rather than give up I turned to the almighty TUBE and found a small 3 part series of videos that broke it all down really easily and quickly.  I can honestly say I'm pretty hooked now. I really like it. For a Free to Play its very good for almost EVERYTHING can be bought or better yet, built with patience, the forge and mats. Of course, you could buy them. But I'm proud to say that I have a Rhino Warframe chassis currently being built and it will be completed early in the morning. (Its like having a new toy in the morning waiting)  So I'm excited, I found a new addiction and am enjoying myself. You might too, its free and I'll link the very helpful videos below.",Recommended,2014.07.10,16.3

Warframe,Micos,"For a F2P game, I am proud to say that I have been part of the community for a few years. Digital Extremes has put tons of effort and hours into the game to make it enjoyable and playable, even with the minor bugs that pop up every so often. A solid game with some story to it; however, if you just want to have a game where you can be a ""space ninja"" that guns down, slices, and murders everything then look no further. Whether you enjoy solo play or team play, Warframe is a game that fits all needs. Even though there is an optional in game payments, it is not necessarily a pay to win. All items, warframes, weapons, and companions are farmable in the game. The use of actual money isn't to make you overpowerd, it is more or less a way for you to get whatever it is you want without the farming (did I forget to mention that there is a lot of grinding in this game for stuff?

Warframe,ᅚᅚ ᅚᅚ ᅚᅚ,"Warframe has been around for years since 2013 and constant updating always makes the game exciting.  A great plot of land is combined here with bright graphics, rich contrasts. The universe of the distant future opens up in the eyes of the players. In this world, there is a constant and fierce struggle for possession of resources and for it's ownership. Creation and disintegration of alliances, some unions fight against others. No one can stay away from these bloody battles.  The game world of Warframe is full of the most extraordinary characters thrown into the game space from all parts of the galaxy. Each player can choose one of the ancient and incredibly powerful contestants in the role of Tenno. The so called warriors, who have spent a century in a temporary state of suspended animation since the completion of the old civil war.  The central characters of the warframe are three war-based factions: The first faction is clones soaked in durable and hard-to-pass armor They use any type of weapon flawlessly. Entrepreneurs can hire a huge number of robots installed on their state-of-the-art technology to protect themselves.  The ""infected"" group includes robots or humans affected by a certain ""technocytic"" plague. The game is extremely dynamic. A character can fight enemies not only in hand-to-hand combat, but also in long-range combat. You can use parkour, which complex elements allow the player to overcome obstacles and countless traps. The player can also prevent himself from being attacked.  Managing the character of the game is very convenient. The physical component of the struggle brings only joy. The number of characters are showing a great deal of variety. None of them are like the other. Turning the role over, the player will definitely find the look and performance in which he feels confident.  The game has an impressive selection of weapons, accessories and supplies to help the player achieve their goals. Another unquestioned advantage of Warframe games: is it's multiplayer project. Through game stages like PVE you can have a multi-team team. But even one player can and will find a lot of interesting things in the game.  The key to success in Warframe - a high level of performance graphics. Other than that this game is great and I love this and I like the community. It definitely makes you feel a valued player while playing the game, which is getting rare with the new era of gaming.  Thank You developers and the ever welcoming player base.",Recommended,2021.05.21,800.4

When everything in my life went down, someone gave me his Account and said ""Go there and find some friends"". Shortly after I found some people who were interested in me and even my problems, We created a Clan and more people joined us. We are like a happy little family. I continued for 7 years as of now and so many amazing things happened: I created a huge Dojo, just so people feel at home here. I got people out of depressions by letting them feel welcome by us. I saved 3 people by talking them out of suicide.  All of these things happened with great joy and when I left for my brain surgery, these people cried for me. The people I gathered for a Clan in a game, cried for me... These people are another family for me.

This game offers a great opportunity to spend a great time with your friend, and have fun while doing it. It's really addictive since you get started to it, with large sets of missions including base defense, survival, boss fights, or killing everyone in the map. One thing I found a bit disturbing, is the fact that level isn't much taken in account. That's pretty great yeah, you can queue up with anyone no matter his level, but when a warframe level 60 comes in with his crowd control skills that annihilate the whole planet, while i still try hard to get one headshot on that small robot that survived the apocalypse, it's kind of a buzzkill when i see I killed 30 while he got 300.

Warframe,Ellie Lockhart,"Warframe is a game deeply cheated by its metacritic scores, the unfair perception that you have to pay to win (I've plzuddAMY F2P MMOs and Warframe is the absolute least unfair in pricing practices), as well as the vastly inferior Destiny series. Apart from being playable on PC, what Warframe brings over Destiny is a truly well thought through lore and plot, but more importantly, it doesn't have an open world. No wandering around looking for map markers - you have a spaceship and a space suit that can fly, so you just drop into missions.

Warframe,Feaukuti,"The game is awesome. It one of the technically best-made games ever....don't need a huge Pc to run it fine and almost don't crash or have anything going bad. Besides this, the game is visually stunning and all the controls, interactions and such works like a charm. Everything is really well made, including the voice acting.  The only (and big) problem is that the game is extremely boring. The missions are extremely repetitive, there's no history plot to follow or anything. It's only about killing waves of enemies to get raw materials to make new types of equipment. And why? Just to unlock more of the same places to kill more waves of the same enemies (of higher level) to get some other raw stuff to make the same types of equipment (of higher level) again.  After crafting and leveling weapons and suits again and again for no apparent reason, you start to wonder if it's worth the time expended in this.  I guess that the only change that I've seen is the arena stuff. Since I don't enjoy PvP in general for the same reason that the game becomes boring after some time (why I should do it? What I get from this?), I can't give a thumbs up for a game that I install and uninstall from time to time.  -----------------------------------------UPDATE---------------------------------------------  After the firing squad whining about the ""only"" 170 hours I had at the time I wrote my first review and the promises of the world changing Second Dream and War Within quests I can surely say that it's pretty much all the same. I've done almost all the quests and one doesn't link to another...it's just small tales on the same old maps.  The CGs where marvelous but that's it. New characters appearing just in those quests that simply doesn't mean anything to the player, new answers for questions never made and new ways of thinking to problems that you never had. As I wrote before, to me, a plot is very important and having none is sometimes better than have some half-baked one. It's ok to spend some time on the wiki to learn about the game but is ridiculous the idea that we need to spend more time reading the wiki instead of playing just to understand who are the characters, their stories and such. If at least there where any official story on the game's website, but there's none.  The game is repetitive and boring. It's up to the player to take a liking of something that each one needs to find on our own (because the game only provides half information - and this is way worse than having none). It's not the way games and gamers usually works. So, this makes Warframe a unique game. Understanding this helps to see the game with a different perspective.  Anyway, since the developers are always creating new content for the game and keeping the game well and evolving (something that I really admire and it's very hard to find in other games) I'll keep with Warframe. The relics system and the possibility to play stealth solo (instead of running the map like a gazelle just to finish the mission under 2 minutes with a team all the time) is actually fun. In the end, this game deserves a thumbs up to honor its outstanding qualities.",Recommended,2018.04.24,2.0

I started playing warframe when chroma came out and it got bored really quick i don't know why, maybe it wasn't the right time for me to play it or the fact that i chose Volt as my main frame. But a couple of months later i decided to give it a second chance and it was the best thing i could've ever done. I started playing it again and started farming, playing, meeting new people and i also started doing quests which i think are the reason i still play warframe today, for that rich lore, and when the second dream came i knew that i was in love with this game. It turned into my favorite game of all time, and the best part is that this is a completely free game, don't let people that say that warframe is pay to win fool you, you can get anything by playing or you can support the developpers and buy some plat, because this game really deserves your money if you can afford it. Please give it a try, at the start it may look difficult but in reality it isn't, you just need to play it and enjoy every single noobie moment that you might have, you can learn how the game truly works later and you'll so accomplished by knowing how does this game works.

The interesting setting for the game and the mysterious plot have really peaked my interest.  Still receives updates even to this day. It might be a bit difficult to understand the game mechanics at first since it has a lot to offer with not enough explaining to the player how things work making it kinda confusing. Don't worry though, there is plenty of guides to help you in this cosmic adventure.",Recommended,2018.11.23,631.3
Warframe,Thornius,"Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Tenno use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through it's Janus Key, the Void called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn it's simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist.

Warframe,Marquis-III,"This Review will be updated after each 100 hours I spent with this game. At the moment I don't think I will stop playing anytime soon. (I did stop by 190 hours, but only to catch a little breath.)  After 100 hours: I am very suprised this game is not talked about more by the gaming jurnalism. Great artstyle, great gameplay (I love the melee combat) and really interesting backstory (or what is visible of it). I love the Warframes and can't wait to try each one of them as they are all different from each other.  After 300 hours: They just keep making this game bigger and better!  After 500 hours: This game is my life now. In a good way.  After 1000 hours: I now play this game on two profiles. One on PC and one on Nintendo Switch. Still great.  It is Free To Play game but you don't really have to buy the Platinum (paid currency) at all as the player-trading system let's you get it fairly easily. And even so, after 30 hours (and then after 35 more) of pure fun I decided to put some money in - so far I have payed around 120 EURO to the devs and I don't regret it in the slightest. Yes, it is kindy ""grindy"" but the grind is still fun and that's what's important.",Recommended,2016.08.10,1.0

If you took the multiplayer co-op from Mass Effect 3, then gave them three extra years to produce and tune it into a full-fledged multiplayer experience; then, you take that game and force feed it piles of amphetamine and hallucenogenic substances. In it's drunken, ball-tripping state, you then force breed said game with Ninja Gaiden.  The resulting spawn from this unholy union of games is: WARFRAME.  Tripped-out, beautiful, intense, challenging, strategic, with incredibly well-developed depth, and... fun. Really one of the greatest all-around co-op experiences I've found. Can't recommend this one enough to anyone I've ever gamed with.  If I had to balance this review with one caveat, it would be that the game is only marginally ""free-to-play"". New players are going to be at a severe disadvantage if they're unwilling to drop a bit of cash on it. This doesn't bother me in the least; I'm of the generation that doesn't mind paying someone for their efforts. Especially when the final product is this great.

After returning, I rediscovered something I'd forgotten from all those hours of playing: despite its flaws, Warframe is, at its core, a genuinely fun game (original review below for reference).  Previous Review: The devs have abandoned what made this game fun in favor of cranking out new ways to monetize this increasingly bloated and tedious game.

Warframe,ABlindGuyPlays,"DE still has issues of when and what feedback they pay attention to. they can be ungodly stubborn on the weirdest of issues, and there are problems aplenty concerning 'how the developers think things should be' vs 'how players actually interact with the game.'  However with all that said? This game has so much stuff to do that if you can find a group of friends? You're solid. The community really is its best feature and the easiest way to avoid feeling burnt out.  Void is Seventeen and had stated he would gladly take down any part of the github repository on request. DE has contacted Void precicely Twice since datamining. Once when he first started to inform him if he continued he would be removed from the design council, and the second tie roughly two days ago giving him what amounted to a Cease and Desist letter, to which he has complied.  I could point to other examples of antagonism between developers and players such as Oberon's Rework, Behavior on Dev-Streams being condescending if not outright mocking, having a community that needs to scream as a collective voice to get 'compromise' measures, and more. However all of these pale in comparison to threatening a minor with legal action rather than attempting to work with this obviously very enthusiastic person to help in not just spreading information across the community and acting as independant verification of released info, but also help track down those that have hacked unreleased items into the game (Excaliber Umbra Prime and Primed Streamline.) Instead they do not go after the actual hackers and go after the prominant largely benign dataminer who has repetedly expressed a willingness to work with Digital Extremes.  I cannot condone this behavior nor will I advise anyone give them business until this matter has resolved as a show of support.",Recommended,2017.06.24,11.0

You have so many options in this games and so many different Warframes to build that it is unreal and just what you can do with them is amazing enough. Everything is so detailed and the possibilities are seemingly endless.  There are so many things you can do to your frame such as skins, upgrading, so many mods...it is just unreal how many directions you get pulled in that you are asking yourself ""Let me try this"" or ""Oh hey I might be able to do this."" You have OPTIONS and you can play around...you aren't really confined to set weapons for each character, you can branch out.  And the part that I like the most...is you can buy weapons sure...but the fact that you EARN them is so much better. You can buy the blueprints to make them and go farm for what you need. Now don't get me wrong...this process can take FOREVER and is a total pain in the backside but in the end it is so worth it because you actualy went out and farmed the materials (yeah call me crazy).

I hope your a social butterfly because your not going to go kirito on this game and beat it solo... not that you can beat mmo's... But any way! Its a terribly repetitive game with more farming going on then in Alabama. The characters leave a lot to be desired, having the most attractive and pleasing models reserved for only the most elite.

There are tons of things you can throw your money at but your paying because your lazy and you want the items now. Its pay because your a bunch' lazy Laurens not pay to win! The developers apparently keep in contact with the community and listen to what they have to say, unlike other corporations like infinityward and treyarch... Or youtube. I personally only play this game because a very sexy, kind and sweet idividual has seduced me into going through the long download and patching process to play with them. Curse these hormones! All in all it depends on you, do you like MMO's? Are you hot enough to make your friends play with you? Like shooter slashers from third person views? Or heck did you like GUN when that was out 3 years ago? Then you'll have fun with this game! Its a free to play in an open beta. Its not my cup of tea but I appreciate what I see them doing, and hope to see them succeed.",Recommended,2013.12.30,10.7

Warframe,5H3N9 (Jayson),"Product received for free  I have played this game about 3 months more. I found this game is kinda hard to start because of the large amout of things you need to know as a beginner. The first 2-3 days of playing this game was totally about knowing what to do. After a week or so, I liked it and I played a lot after understanding what to do or what you want to do it's more of a casual game. This game is kinda like farming things mostly but this way of farming is actually kinda cool and fun as this is more like an action game. This is a totally free to play game because you can farm good things to sell it for platinum(as the most valued currency in the game) and use that platinum to buy something even better or something you really like. In this game everyone plays with different styles, some like to farm and sell and do their business in buying and selling, some like to cuztomize their Warframes, space ship or even their pets to look cool and stylish. This is a game that girls and guys can play because of the variety of play styles it has, it is a game for everyone.

Warframe,Brianna,"PLEASE DESTINY PLAYERS, GIVE THIS GAME A CHANCE, AT LEAST 20-40 HOURS.  Now, I know that's a big ask, but that's a well-dedicated amount of time to get a few planets through.  Warframe is the game that I want all Destiny 2 retirees to transition to, because its the power-scaling Destiny player desire, and more. Namely, more fluid modding system, with enemies that don't just fall over, so you can build something unique or meta to kill crowds in ways you enjoy. There's so much content. Like so much, it's insane, and all of it's free. Let me repeat that, ALL OF IT IS FREE. Now I don't know if you got it already, but LITERALLY ALL THE CONTENT, FROM AWAKENING TO THE UPCOMING 1999 (and future releases) ARE FREE.  The forge has ""waiting times"" that should not be looked at as time gates, since there's tons to do in the meantime, and theyre usually not that drastic, at most, three days, and that's just for making Warframes, most things are 12 hours and you can just put a bunch of stuff in the forge to build before bed, and then wake up the next day to them being finished building. There's also a mobile app where you can manage your forge from your phone. You also don't have a limit on how many things can be building at once. But I do not recommend rushing any build if it is not free, plat is a precious currency for trading.  Barely anything has ever been removed, anything that has been removed has been so in the TRUEST interest of the players.  The premium currency is tradeable, with a whole economy around mods and prime parts. The devs make sure the market for some older parts don't get too expensive from scarcity by resurgence rotations that bring back old parts, quite frequently.  There's a dozen things i could gush about this game, because it's good. The devs care. They talk and play with the community daily. I've encountered devs in game in the wild a few times, and tons of players have as well. Please Destiny players, either find a Warframe vet to help you through the ropes of the game or go in blindly, but please give this game a try. It's free, so you won't regret it.",Recommended,2023.04.27,2.0
Warframe,Little Boot,"I played Warframe some years ago, and I have recently returned to it. It has changed consideraby over the intervening period.  The Good: -  1) Great graphics. 2) Incredibly fun gameplay. 3) Generally stable, with a decent ping and few connection or lag issues. 4) Easy grouping and quick access to quests. 5) A moderately interesting story mode. 6) Many weapons and suits to collect, which come in normal and prime (prime is a higher qaulity version).  The Bad: -  1) Becomes repetitieve quickly, such that the grind for the prime warframes will probably extend beyond your forebearance for repeating the same content over and over. 2) The cash shop items (particularly warframes and weapons) seem to be there to entice new players. In most instances you will be able to buy the elements required to make a Prime version of a suit more cheaply from other players than the inferior version of a suit from the cash shop. 3) Most player-player trades are for platinum (real-world money surrogate), and there is no auction house, meaning new or inexperienced players may get ripped off, and finding equipment to buy can take time. 4) Many of the missions are designed in such a way that players rush through them. This can become annoying if you want to collect resources, or just play at a more relaxed pace, and you may find yourself soloing often. 5) Many of the menus and game systems are counter-intuitive and could be designed to be more user friendly.  Conclusion: -  A fun game well worth playing, but with limited longevity.",Recommended,2017.08.09,124.2

You need to do allot to get allot out of it. If you like grindy games, and are easily entertained like I am, This is the game for you to try!  The best part i like about this game is it's free to play. Eveything is free in it. The only thing that costs virtually anything would have to be platinum for the in-game currency, or to buy the upgrade packs. But this game is good so i say give it a shot and i bet you'll enjoy it!

Edit:  It's constantly being updated; I started from U5, now we're at U19, it's crazy. The updates bring in story, past, and background of the Tenno, as well as tilesets, weapons, new frames, etc.; along with other things held for zero spoils. It's refreshing from what it used to be, but the grind is still there, new mechanics are being placed in, old systems are being rebuilt anew.

Warframe,Clover,"I started playing warframe very reluctantly. I didn't want another grindy mmo to take up my time. Now, 1,155 hours and a year later.... It's made my top 5 favorite games of all time. So, what gives?  -One of the BEST Sci-Fi Storylines to ever exist in a game. (And it's ever-evolving!) -Amazingly fun combat system that has completely removed ANY desire to play a FPS ever again. -The MOST customization I've ever seen in ANY game. From menu colors, to sounds, to music, to characters, to weapons (build your own, or modify any existing one to your hearts desire!), to warframes, to ships, to homes, to clan worlds, to settings, (Not a fan of blood and gore? Turn it off. BIG FAN? MAXIMIZE IT!) the list goes on and on beyond what I can write here.  Last, but not least. -The best community on the internet. Need to restore your faith in humanity? Play this game. The community IS the best I have ever seen. Out of 1,000 hours and a year of playing, I ran into one rude person. ONE! And between all my friends, less than 5 out of 6 years of playing warframe. People are helpful and kind and funny, and it's a place where you can go and feel good, have fun and just relax with a bunch of good people.  It's a fast paced action game, that's never felt grindy to me. And when I'm tired of the action, I can go fishing on a planet, or hunting or just decorate my space ship.

If you dislike P2Win games, then you might like thist one. The only things you have to pay for is your own lazyness, your looks and convenience. Although you can grind everything, even the real money currency called Platinum. just by selling stuff you find in the game, you can exchange it for Platinum at the trading channel. So you don't really have to pay for it.

Warframe,Emaulligu,"Just reached 1000 hours, I guess this calls for a proper review. I'd like to begin with a statement : this game is about grinding. Like it, don't like it, it's a fact. If you don't, then the game is most likely not for you. Then there's people downvoting the game after 8000 hours because ""there's nothing left to do"". lol  Warframe isn't the bad type of grinding game. No capped XP or resource. Want to do a hardcore 5 hours farming session to stack up for months ? Go ahead. You can buy boosters for premium currency, just like you can earn them as a daily log-in bonus. And the base progression rate are fairly acceptable.  So where does the game funding comes from ? Running and developping such a game takes a lot of money. For a part, Tennogen collections, which are a set of extra cosmetics only purchaseable with real money. No game-changer here, just wild ""FashionFrame"" battles between veterans chilling in the chat or relays. Two, inventory slots. Yeah, you heard that right. The only way to expand your Warframe and weapon armory is to pay Platinum, the premium currency. You can't avoid that, but fear not, for that premium currency is tradeable between players ! Got some extra Prime parts ? Head over the trade channel and get a deal. Three, crafting times. Welp, the foundry takes some time. 12 to 24 hours for a gun, 72 hours for a full Warframe. That sounds like a mobile game cashgrab, I agree. But I'm willing to be patient and make that concession to keep the rest of the game free. It's a long-term game, waiting until tomorrow for your new shiny won't kill you.  The upgrade system for both the Warframes and weapons is good and effective. You can fine-tune your weapons in a lot of different ways until you've found which one performs the best against one of the three factions. Mindless bashing won't get you to endgame, not if you don't know what you're doing.  The game doesn't hold your hand. There's a huge wiki, with plenty of data on it. There's guides on Steam, on Youtube, for beginners, for trading, for every specific aspect of the game that may require a tutorial. Be weary of spoilers though, the story plays a good part of the middle-game gameplay. It's going to take you a few hundred hours to catch up with the current state of the main storyline, depending of how fast you go. The amount of content is crazy. Sure you can speedrun and get there in no time, but that's not the point.  I have played 1000 hours without spending a cent. This game is one of the truest free-to-play game I could find. No pay-to-win, only pay to go faster or look shinier. But why buy something when you can painfully farm it for hours ? Makes you so happy when you finally get around parading with it. Okay, I gotta be a bit mental lol. But hell, this game is a lot of fun to play.  Nobody is probably seeing this review ever anyway, but if anyone needs help or has questions, I'll be happy to answer them in the comments, in addition to the numerous guides you'll find on Steam who can probably do it better regardless.",Recommended,2014.07.20,2.0

Warframe,KaShrax,"Having played quite a lot for almost 2 years I can highly recommend playing warframe, but only if you have got some time to get into it, it is slow to get started but at an enjoyable pace if played with a couple of mates that can quickly get you through your first few missions, mods, and a new weapon and warframe to venture out on your own with. It can be a bit of a grind getting everything you need to get that new frame or weapon that was just released but again, when played with a bunch of friends and you combine your missions for everything you team wants to get, it is a tonne of fun. I think they are getting a bit complex now - but the devs have always done an awesome job of not only adding new content but making sure that they can please their fan base while trying to enlarge it. The Live dev streams are also pretty cool. If you get into it, you will probably spend more money on this free to play than any other title you ever bought outright.

The game has a growing number of missions and environments to explore, and well-rounded equipment to choose from to match your play style. This game is NOT Pay-To-Win, as most items in the game can be acquired easily with the right amount of time spent. I had thought of this game as Pay-To-Win at one point when I was first starting out and that's because I never put in the time to gather the resources and make my own stuff like I do now. The game encourages you to level up your gear and experiment with each kind, as this will give you experience if you do, and halt your experience if you do not. Surprisingly, this is actually a good thing and actually enhances your experience. This game could use a few tweaks but you can't blame the thing considering its only in open beta for the moment and trust me, alpha was much worse if you're having problems adapting to open beta. I must say that as a free-to-play game, Warframe is a nice surprise that sets the base for a promising future of free-to-play games.",Recommended,2015.05.27,420.3

Warframe,Tato,"ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA   English:  Prefixing that the Steam game time isn't correct, and that is since the first Closed Beta that i'm a member of the Warframe community, i guarantee that this game is awesome. i've been watching it growing up, being developed step by step with the improvement and the progressive addition of contents. What about, the graphic is great and also the gameplay. As in every Free2Play, you can Shop items with real money, but the concept of ""Pay2Win"" is definetly relative: All the items and the equipments that you can Shop, you can also get them by playing well and a lot, with patience. What else? It's based on Teamplay as every good PVE has to be, and the variety of playable Warframe and Weapons (In constant increasing) is impressive. The only defect it's that the scenario tends to be repetitive in long times. Trust me, and give it a try, possibly with some friends, you will not regret. (Sorry for my bad english.)    Premettendo che il tempo di gioco di Steam è inesatto, e che è dai tempi della Closed Beta che faccio parte della community di Warframe, vi assicuro che questo gioco è geniale. L'ho visto crescere, venire sviluppato passo per passo con il miglioramento e la progressiva aggiunta di contenuti. Che dire, la grafica è ottima e il gameplay pure. Come in ogni Free2Play non manca la possibilità di Shop ma il concetto di ""Pay2Win"" è decisamente relativo: Tutto ciò che può essere comprato nello Shop si può benissimo ottenere con impegno e pazienza, guadagnandolo all'interno del gioco. Che altro dire? E' incentrato sul gioco di squadra come ogni buon PVE dovrebbe essere e la varietà di armi e e Warframe giocabili (Tra l'altro, in continuo aumento) è impressionante. L'unica pecca è che le ambientazioni alla lunga risultano ripetitive, ma questo accade nella maggior parte dei F2P.

Warframe,Callsign_Nova,"Warframe is an awesome free to play game, with so much to offer. The new Eidelon update has really opened this game up to so many more possibilities. I found fishing and mining quite enjoyable while just sitting and wanting to waste some time, but it also can be quiet addictive.  The selection of warframes is so vast and easy to switch out as you need them so you are not bound to one frame the whole time you play. The customisation of each frame makes eah and every frame very unique to another players which I feel is really awesome.  The clan dojos have a great deal of potential, they are at the moment a great place to gather with your fellow tenno but are quick lacking in decor and functional items other than the Labs and training rooms giving the grand scale of the dodo a very empty feel.",Recommended,2013.11.27,2.0
Warframe,Jaykoboy,"(Updating my Review since a lot has changed since I last threw one out there)  Warframe is not a game for everyone. It's grindy, its aesthetic can sometimes be a bit unnerving without context, and at times it can feel slow. But if you like slowly working to better yourself, both through practice and striving for better equipment, this game is a fantastic investment of time.  Being free helps a lot, but Digital Extremes are fantastic devs, who've made this F2P game probably one of the most consumer-friendly games on the market. I often find myself buying platinum (the premium currency) and packs of goodies just to help support the devs.  On top of that, the gameplay loop itself is fantastic and fast-paced. After years of patching and balancing, there's very few Warframes (the 'characters' you play as that define your power set) and weapons that aren't at least a bit viable, and almost all of them are distinct in their playstyle and role.  Would I recommend this game? In a heartbeat. But I have to reiterate - this game is not for everyone. Don't feel bad or pressured in to playing it just because everyone else thinks it's good. If it's not your cup of tea, if the grind puts a bit too much weight on you, if you struggle to find stuff to do in a vacuum...at least give it a shot, but don't feel bad for putting it down.",Recommended,2013.06.29,793.1

I can't thank enough to DE for making such a good game, so I'll keep playing and enjoying new updates and incomming features. I fully recommend playing this game. Are you ready tenno?  After 160 hours of gameplay: It's amazing how it can go from nothing to just have a lot of things. I still enjoy the game, I love that farming never ends, and I love that the DE team keeps working on new updates and new features and missions. You can get bored doing something but you can still do a lot of other things to enjoy, that's one of the main reasons why I keep playing this game.  270 hours: I still love this game. Anyways there are still a lot of bugs to fix (that's why we call it Bugframe) but let's be honest, it's a huge game and it's free.

However, outside of a few community made cosmetics, you can get pretty much everything with enough patience, luck and will to grind for some components.

Warframe,T-dog,"Warframe is a game I have recently clocked my 600th hour in, and I can now safely say it's been worth all the time spent.  Cons: -The game is a grindy game. Although there is a huge amount of content you will find yourself playing some missions over repeatedly for resources or blueprints. But it is personally not an obstacle, if you just accept it's the way it is, you won't find it too bad. - Although a big update is coming (Plains of Eidolon) that promises new end game content, the game doesn't offer the most sensational experience when you have your 'ultimate loadout' completed.  Pros: -The game is filled to the brim with content, there is simply so much to do, you won't be bored for the first 200 hours for sure. The best thing is that you unlock more content as you progress, especially story-based cinematic quests are really interesting, which you unlock much later in the game. - Customization is great, you can make your own warframe just like you want it, using colours and armor pieces to customize the looks, and so called mods to tweak the abilities of your warframe. This makes the game a very personalized experience. - The community is great, if you ever need help with anything, just ask. Although I'm not sure how, the game has so many people willing to help out, you never have to do something alone really. - More content coming, there is still so much coming. Recently the devs have announced a new open world and another cinematic quest. It's nothing new that Digital Extremes will keep adding things to do to this game.",Recommended,2017.08.14,1.0

Warframe,Farah,"This is a space-based video game available on various platforms and consoles, such as Playstation, Xbox and PC.  The game itself has a very steep learning curve. The tutorials do not explain the key aspects of the game, as the developers believe that a player has the biggest sense of triumph when they figure the game out themselves. Despite this, many tutorials exist online and are rather easy to find, so whether the player decides to carry on the journey to learn the game themselves or follows tutorials, is purely on them.  This game is very unique in its free-to-play model. The game and all content are unlocked and acquirable through hard work. You are rewarded for playing and challenging yourself, and as this is something rarely seen in games with such a large playerbase, it sets Warframe apart from other MMORPGs. How much you achieve depends entirely on how much time and effort you put into the game. You can speed things up by dropping a few bucks to support the game and its development, but the most expensive real-money-currency (known as platinum) things you can get are only cosmetics. You can purchase pre-built Warframes (characters) and weapons for platinum for an overpriced amount, specifically set high to encourage you to play the game and get it the hard way. You can earn platinum through in-game trades. Yes, you can actually spend some time to acquire parts which can be traded. You can get even cosmetics for a little bit of effort. Very few games in the industry have such freedom for their players, for the fear of the freedom being exploited. Warframe has excellent security and bot management which results in an enjoyable gaming experience for all players.  The game has quite a few dozen playable characters, all with different sets of unique abilities and hybrid roles, as well as HUNDREDS of weapons! No two weapons are the same functionality nor appearance wise. The weapons fall into the categories of primary, secondary, and melee. If you're not a fan of shooter games you can use a melee weapon as a main weapon, and turn to a hack n' slash playstyle. You can snipe with bows or one of the unique snipers, or if that's out of your league, you can spam character abilities, and wipe rooms full of enemies clean!  Every single stat on every weapon and character can be modified using 'mods'. So on top of being able to mix and match your weapons loadout, it is up to you to decide whether your weapon has a better fire rate or more damage.  Their quests and lore are enough to reduce their playerbase to tears with unseen plot-twists, and character progression. There are about two dozen quests available right now, unlocked with account level only, which means you have to take your time to settle into the world of Warframe before you can discover the story behind it. You don't begin the game until you're about a hundred hours in, which is when the story begins.  In conclusion, Warframe offers a lot of choice and begs for player decision making during gameplay. It is an interactive game where the choices you make determine the personality of your character. You can customise almost anything, and reflect your character and weapons with colors you love, it has a detailed combat system, many enemies, a lot of things to do as well as different playstyles which appeal to a broad sample of players. I recommend this game from the bottom of my heart, it has been updated in the right direction over the years I've followed it, with developers listening closely to their playerbase. It is one of the most popular games right now, and kind and caring developers with a gift for attention to detail, are the main reason behind it!",Recommended,2014.10.08,3.0

The opening of the game is going to be rough for any new Tenno, but if you can find a friend to help guide you through the rough spots and get you into the beginning of the story line, a whole universe opens up, with a rich back-story behind it.  The game has been through massive changes since I originally wrote this review, and I felt it needed an update. You can now build your own war ship, and in coming months you'll be able to take it out of the dry-dock into space and literally attack the space pirates and other entities that plague the system.

Warframe,Jadey,"Warframe, a Third Person Shooter set in a futuristic style. Join me and hop into a ""Warframe"", its time to explore.  From an ancient slumber you awaken, a slumber that would only be undone by a threat wich plagues the planets and solar systems. The Grineer have come to take you, it is time to do what you are supposed to do, save everything.  Warframe is (again) a Third Person Shooter set in a futuristic style, you are able to control these solid and strong husks known as ""Warframes"", they range from Tanks who take a lot of damage to the more stealthy types, allowing you to complete missions without being seen.  Warframe has you take on allot of farming at all times as to create Weapons, Sentinels who act as your companion and fight allongside you or even new Warframes.  Weapons vary greatly, from low magazine count Twin Vipers with a fast fire rate and reload speed to Bows and Assault Rifles. There is always a weapon that will interest you, be it a sniper to fire from afar or a bow to get those silent kills.  Sentinels are a great addition to the game, each equipped with their own Weapon. From poison darts to a fully automatic assault rifle. They also add a more in depth part of Warframe, each they come with various abilities, for example : Carrier has the ability to pickup loot within a specific radius of you. Whereas Deathcube will Vaporize enemies.  Warframes are ofcourse the husks you control, ranging from Tanks like Rhino who has massive amounts of stomping power to the more silent Warframe like Ash. There is a Warframe for each style of play, so you'll be sure to find a Warframe to your liking.  The enemies : - Grineer - Corpus - Infested  The Grineer : The Grineer are an advanced race using weapons like Assault Rifles, Machine Guns, Cleavers and anything that would use normal bullets or slash through flesh.  The Corpus : The Corpus are an even more advanced race that use weapons which work on energy like the Flux Rifle and their Electrified Batons.  The Infested : The Infested as the name says are infected beings whom are mutated, they range from exploding enemies (Kamikazes), Ancient whom can heal their allies and infested dogs whom are fast with a strong attack.  Each enemy has their own weakness leading to some interesting encounters, with ""Boss"" enemies that have been put into the game whom have the ability to shield themselves with ice to a fire blast knocking you back.  The Farming : Warframe imo seems to be the game which you'd love to play if you enjoy some fun sessions in farming for resources. Each planet comes with its own resources, one better then the other.  All in all, Warframe is a great game. Its something you won't find everyday and is defenitly worth it to take a look at and playing it.  Warframe will be the game for you if you enjoy the joys of farming wich come with interesting missions, special bosses for each faction and the joy of brutally murdering enemies in various ways with the different Warframes abilities.",Recommended,2013.06.24,2.0

BUT it's one of the best looking and feeling games of all time. the art design is godlike and belongs in a museum. the skins alone are of such an artistical quality, it's insane. and, of course, the movement is absolutely great as well, it just feels great. and yeah, I love it again. and hopefully this time I'll learn enough to enjoy this in the future alone!",Recommended,2023.10.12,69.1

Warframe,Riedok,"it's an amazing and addictive game. plenty of stuff to grind for and it's quality is better than some games that require money.  Pros: -it's fun - a lot to do - updates pumped out every few months -a great community -massive arsenal to pick and choose from -near everything can be obtained for free -the trading system  cons: -Grinding can be boring at times and cause burnout -Power creep  if you want more proof that its addicting look at my hours played  i stand by my points above however i have grown in my additional 7k hrs of play so ill be adding more  pros: -Great visuals -Cool Warframe designs -Fast paced, smooth gameplay -Tons of weapons and frames to unlock -Hundreds of mods to collect -Frequent updates, special events, new content to look forward to -Not pay-to-win  Cons: -Cooperative online play doesn't encourages players to play as a team -Lackluster mission objectives -A lot of bugs -Slow start -Insufficient tutorial, too much left unexplained -Grindy, and can be repetitive -Some weapons simply suck, or are made obsolete by purely superior options -Peer-to-peer system can make games laggy, especially when connecting to others in different countries  If you don't mind the grind, the game can be a lot of fun, especially if you can find a group of people to do runs with. The fairly weak tutorial can be supplemented with a trip to the wiki. If you enjoy fast combat and collecting tons of stuff, then there's plenty of both.  if you think its for you:",Recommended,2017.07.30,14.0

Warframe,GreatOldScholarchsaur,"With beautiful graphics, great gameplay, a variety of missions to complete, many scenarios, many bosses, strong RPG elements, good reasons to fight bosses, and great Co-Op gameplay earns this game a huge thumbs up, not even considering the fact it's free. With events, frequent updates, and even more stuff promised it is a great game and I heartily recommend it! The only downside I can think of is the need of 'platinum', money you'll have to purchase with actual money. This should be resolved with rare chances to gain platinum, other than that this game is magnificent. Ignore the metagame score, it deserves much more!  Update on this review: Warframe's a gift that just keeps on giving. Currently it has 6 factions of varying sizes, a codex system, a revamped damage system, tons of weapons, 20 warframes to choose from, a variety of missions, a whole starmap to fill, tons of leveling up, frequent updates, frequent events, hidden areas, and at least 8 variations of randomly assembled tile sets.

Warframe,Figgleknob,"Warframe........ How do i put this? Warframe is an excellent game and that is putting it lightly. Warframe is basically about futuristic space sci fi that involves humanity becoming mutated and corrupted, the main characters you play as are called warframes, which are like awesome space ninjas. They are basically either super evolved technology that is worn to keep the corrupted humans or (tenno) stable or they are the result of mutations to the tenno. Either way they each have their own unique looks and powers, you can customise your ones to your own liking and desire. You play the game by doing missions, these involve you flying down to a planet in your spaceship, then depending on what mission type you are doing you must complete the main objective. An example of this includes exterminate missions, these missions are your typical and easier missions in my opinion. Basically the main objective is to go all space ninja on all the enemies till none of them are left standing, seems simple enough. The more harder missions can include defense or spy missions, i won't go too much into what they are as to not spoil the entire game for you new players. I've been playing this game for a good few years and it just seems to get better and better as the time goes on, the developers add new content at a decent pace and keep us the consumer interested. It really keeps me enjoying myself to fullest at every corner. However..... there is only 1 problem with this game in my opinion, this problem seems to occur in most free to play games. I'm refering to of course pay to play issue, now unlike world of warcraft and other free to play games, warframe does allow you to get the complete experience of the game for free, they allow this by letting players doing the missions and farming parts of weapons, cosmetics, even other warframes you can build and obtain for no real money what so ever YAY!!!!! and for those lazy players who can't be stuffed to put the time into farming for the things they want, we are able to buy whatever we want for real money. A tactical advantage to the devs but can be worth it for us sometimes. However... there is a catch to those of us who want to get the stuff for free and this is the problem i was refering to, that is how the game works with this. Sure put hours on end to farm the parts and make your new weapons and warframes, etc but... each warframe, weapon etc needs a slot to be placed in within your inventory and guess what... that costs real money to get more HAHAHAHAHA what a messed up catch, sure it's not as expensive as buying the thing you want in the first place but it's still really cheeky on the devs part. Letting people get whatever they want for free only to spend cash for space in their iventory to aquire this so called (free {whatever you are building} ) Oh and when you build the stuff for free it does take real hours to be made, just another set back for some people, me? im not as fussed about that as others. But besides that little cheeky issue with having to buy slots to put the stuff you want for free in I have absolutley nothing bad to say about warframe. It's a wonderful game and like i previously mentioned, it keeps getting better to some degree :D. And as such i look forward to the future sessions of playing warframe that are yet to come. Would i recommend this game? hell yeah! no questions asked i think the majority of gamers out there would love this. if you are a player that doesn't like spending real money on games you already bought then... i don't think you'd like this too much but other then that :D absolutley i recommend this !",Recommended,2015.07.10,3.0

It has a way of implementing different gaming characteristics into a very stylized atmosphere; puzzles, shooting, stealth, alerts, parkour, overall beautiful lighting and settings and character custimization. Yes, there is a lot of grinding and farming for items if you don't want to pay real money to get such things sooner, but at least you feel like a badass doing so.

Warframe,Naf-Naf,"To play Warframe is to reconcile yourself with the sensation that you're always a bit in over your head. Even six years after its debut, it's still something of an oddity within the realm of online action-RPGs. With an expanding universe housing a wealth of content, the free-to-play game offers a stellar amount of freedom to explore, uncover loot, and take on missions with its cast of stylish space ninjas. It takes a decidedly unorthodox approach with its non-linear adventure--sometimes frustratingly so--yet journeying across Warframe's massive universe is as satisfying as it is endearing.  When it comes to its gameplay and narrative, Warframe always seems to chuck you into the deep end. The larger story focuses on an interstellar clan of warriors known as the Tenno as they reacquaint themselves with a grander universe in perpetual conflict. You take control of a reawakened Frame--revitalized Tenno fighters from the distant past--to engage in missions against a myriad of enemy factions. This conceit of spacefaring ninjas slashing and shooting across the universe holds the loose narrative together while also giving you an impressive amount of freedom. Several cinematic quests shed light on the history of the Tenno, leading up to some profound moments that reveal a surprising depth for your character and their place in the galaxy.  Warframe is a massive game with numerous, complex systems to dive into--but therein lies the rub. It's a challenging game to crack; even with hundreds of hours under my belt, I can still feel overwhelmed by how much game there is to unpack. However, the trick to understanding this game lies within finding your own focus in the nebulous grind--whether that's taking on a variety of side-activities and missions on a series of planets or investing time to customize, experiment, and tweak your favorite Frames.  It can often feel like playing catch-up, considering there is six years' worth of content in the package, but it's a game that rewards taking the time to soak it all in, instead of rushing through. How you get accustomed to this surprisingly sink-or-swim structure will determine the mileage you get out of it. Most missions are singular, discrete encounters across the solar system. This piecemeal structure ultimately makes the massive game more digestible. There's a staggering amount of activities to dive into, and with over 40 hyper-stylized Frames to utilize, there's a constant sense of fun and surprise when discovering how deep it all runs. However, while the opening missions do well to get you into the basic swing of things when it comes to its core gameplay, the more in-depth systems are left for you to decipher on your own.  This mostly hands-off approach in getting you acclimated can sometimes manifest feelings of aimlessness. And it's magnified when it becomes apparent that there isn't a traditional endgame to work up to. There are higher-end missions and stories designed for more experienced players, some focusing on endless fights against waves of enemies, but there isn't anything like raids to unlock later on. In many ways, you're introduced to that familiar endgame grind from the onset, and that often entails fine-tuning your suite of Frames to tackle many of the game's tougher challenges.  There is a ridiculous amount of room to experiment, and it can be especially fun strengthening one of the beginner Frames with powerful mods and armaments that can melt through enemies. It's also impressive how in-depth customization and personalization is in Warframe--you can apply different shaders, accessories, and even alter their particular animation set, and it's rare to find another player who has the same style and loadout.  It's a necessity to get your Frame to reach its potential for them to be viable for more advanced activities. If you don't apply the correct mods and buffs to your character, it can often stop you in your tracks at some inconvenient moments in your progression. If you're committed to figuring out the intricacies of the game, then using online guides to understand these advanced mechanics, much like with other aspects of the game, is a must. These resources are a big help, but it's disappointing how often you have to use them, as opposed to the game teaching you the same information. Without them, learning these systems on your own can be a significant test of patience.  You'll quickly find yourself in a rhythm of cutting down mobs of enemies and boosting your Frame's strength by collecting mods and earning experience as new gameplay systems and events open up. While the core gameplay is often satisfying, it's still common to see a streak of highly repetitive missions, most of which re-use tile-sets for procedurally-generated levels and objective types. This repetition can create a recurring feeling of déjà vu throughout, and there were times when this left me feeling exhausted after an extended play session with the game.  To help ease this sense of repetition, Warframe does inject a number of variations on standard missions, as well as adding in new activities. Along with Nightmare challenges, harder versions of previously completed levels, several missions even remix past stages by including multiple enemy factions within one level, making some standard objectives far more hectic. Some objectives feature totally different gameplay modes, in particular incorporating the Archwing, which switches up the familiar action sequences with Wing Commander-style shooter levels. There's even a set of PvP game types, such as the Conclave and Duel modes, with the latter letting you invite another player to a player-made clan dojo to engage in a solo fight. Unfortunately, the PvP activities come across as exceedingly basic and clunky compared to the core PvE experience.  Despite how much the game has grown over the years by adding in game-changing features, Waframe's roots are still planted firmly in its fast-paced and satisfying core combat. The overall speed and flexibility in its action is something that it continually excels at, and there's a constant sense of grace and finesse that can make even the ordinary missions thrilling. It often shows similar shades to a fast-paced corridor shooter by way of a stunning character-action game, with your squad tearing through enemies using myriad skills and armaments.  The game still has issues with repetition and lack of explanations for its more complex systems, but it's managed to overcome their severity by introducing so many events and revisions that continue to elevate it. While there are inevitable bouts of frustration here and there, I always manage to center myself once I move on to other opportunities. In a lot of ways, that's what Warframe manages to do best. One moment you're taking part in a random spy mission on Saturn, and the next, you're partnered up with a powerful squad of players that help you through several void fissures. Just when you feel like you've hit a lull, a better, and more fulfilling opportunity will likely present itself. Perhaps most importantly, Warframe makes sure that the time spent in its world is almost always well rewarded.",Recommended,2019.09.24,51.1

Warframe,noiru [ 黒 ],"Warframe is a free to play third person shooter game combined with melee combat and parkour system with great mechanics.Warframe is one of the best F2P games out there.""This game is'nt a P2W game"".You could get anything without spending any real money in the game by simply ""FARMING"".There are lots of weapons,warframes,and mods to modify your warframes and weapons with stats that you can get easily.There are lots of Customization for your Warframes e.g:Colors,Syandana,Weapons Colors,Helmet,and etc.Even though it costs Plats (platinum) for you to buy colors normally,you could actually got lots of colors for free when there is an event like Halloween,Christmast,or the other celebration day.There are also lots of relays and trading places for trading with other people,and there is also a clan system inside the game.The Quests are also Awesome with some cinematics that you won't forgot like the Second Dream or The War Within,but i dont want to spoiler the inside of the quest...So Warframes is simply a ""MUST TRY""!!!",Recommended,2017.08.31,406.6
Warframe,ThaDaLinkWent,"Warframe is one of those games that's a diamond in the rough. It's a really great game only if you're willing to invest some serious time into it. It's easy to play this game for 30 minutes or an hour and say, ""I don't know what I'm doing."" or ""This game is bland and generic."" You really have to sit down with this game and give it some time before you find your own unique niche and fighting style. With each warframe you play with you realize you have to adjust and adapt your tactics to the strategic situation. Each frame has it's own unique powers so it's good to know how to utilize them for the right situation at the right time.   The more difficult battles in the game must be calculated carefully. Attributing factors about how to fight can be simply broken down like this: speed vs power, power vs technique, technique vs speed, power vs crowd control and crowd control vs stealth. Those where just some examples of factors to take into consideration when finding your fighting style but there are many more. Now with the right modifications for weapons and warframes you can begin to merge the abilities together into a super effective fighting style but again that takes time.   The fact that the game has multiplayer co-op in it as well really helps with the later levels of this game. Trying to go solo in this game works but for so long before you're going to need reinforcements. With the right team and proper weapons you can seem almost unstoppable at times. But that's also the beauty of the design of this game. It always makes you feel like you can always get stronger without making you feel like you're invincible and you have to stop trying. There's always something or someone out there that's just little bit stronger than you that's what keeps you going in your pursuit to improve yourself.   As I said before the game is a diamond in the rough and there are some obnoxious sections or situations the game might put you through. For example the drop rate for certain rare materials is ultra low meaning you'll be grinding on a level until you get the materials you need making so some stages very redundant. Or you'll find out you need to clear a specific level with a squad yet nobody breathes on that particular level you're trying to get through which makes waiting painful at times. If you don't feel like waiting for a squad to show up, they give you the option to start the mission by yourself anytime. But be forewarned you better be SUPER prepared if you're going solo.   Minors flaws and nuisances aside, all and all it's a great game and a good time that's definitely worth a try. Even better when you bring your friends along for the journey. As with all reviews give it a try and play the game yourself at least once before you take someone else's review as gospel or fact and you decide for yourself whether or not the reviewer made a fair point or not.",Recommended,2015.02.09,410.5

Warframe,Pyramid Head's Meat Socket,"Best free to play game in the market given that the game has continued to survive for over a decade, which is something you have to keep in mind. All the events and story missions and weapons and warframes are decades worth of content so you definitely need a wiki in hand and a clan you can join to ground yourself. The market ingame is a noob trap. To put it in easier terms, think of Destiny 2's cash shop, except the premuim currency can be traded with other players freely and seamlessly with 2FA and protections in place to protect against bots. The grind for high level loot has been reduced so much that the new game plus star map with harder difficulty is where most people go to spend their time once they feel they finished the base star chart.  The game devs engage with players through regular dev streams with twitch drop rewards so be sure to at least claim those rewards they are very good, they continue to implement changes to make the game better, but you will burn out with how much content there is. It's a game best played when you have nothing to play or are tired of other games. Something to fill the gaps when you don't know what to get on Steam and can run on a potato so it is not demanding at all. The resources online to help with builds, alerts, reward tracking and marketplace prices for items are tailor made to make the game enjoyable and fast.  Give Warframe a try especially if you have friends that already play the game, and take your own time with the game, as mentioned before you will burn out if you're trying to do too much in a short amount of time.",Recommended,2016.07.03,4.0

Warframe,MindlessPig,"This is an amazing game if you just want to sit back and have a good time slaughtering everything in your path! Beginer players might have trouble at first figuring out the market and modding system, but there are in game tutorials and internet tutorials to help with that. Warframe is constintly puting out new content about every week, and usually on wednesdays so veteran players like me keep getting new content to keep us working at it. I currently have over 400 hours logged into the game and im still very much enjoying it! Overall once you figure out how to do most of the beginer stuff it is a very relaxing game. If you want you can sit back and do easy missions, but if you in the mood for more of a challenge you can face off against players around your skill level. Some of you might say that all free games are pay to win, however I havn't spent a dime on this game and i still get the items that people pay for. You see there is a big trading system that players trade items for the currency that cost real money. It works out very well.

Warframe,Unzen,"192 out of 193 achievements done. Still login daily. Still play occasionally.  Some great ideas (railjacks, archwings, modding trees and unlocks) counteracted by some awful ones like the Operator Mode - which nearly single-handedly made me quit the game altogether. I'd even pay for a version of Warframe that didn't need or use the Operator - I despise it that much! Also, frankly bizarre lore and increasingly convoluted background stories that I am simply aloof to. In fact, the last quest I completed without the faintest idea of what I had just done or the consequences of that.  I feel that if DE could ease off on the 'additions' for a while and focus on core game functions such as AI behaviour - that would massively make the game more interesting to all. The enemy AI is beyond stupid - made worse when you use a silent weapon alongside a stealthy 'frame like Loki. He's been one of the OG units from the very beginning, so there's very little excuse to make the enemies so oblivious to the fact that they have just witnessed him impale three colleagues to the wall and they just stand waiting their turn to be shot.  When it flows and comes altogether - Warframe is a shining example of how a PvE co-op game should be. If you can see past the endless and contrived drivel spewed out in the quests and instead, jump in with some similar level players - it really is fun. More so, that very moment when shuffling the mods and equipping those that are complementary to one another together - suddenly makes sense. Light-bulb moments in gaming have rarely been as rewarding.",Recommended,2015.02.28,2.0

Warframe,Riccorbypro,"TL;DR: Highly recommend this game, top of my All-Time favourites list.  So, my 2 cents about Warframe:  Pros: Easy to pick up, difficult to master Storyline is gripping, and side quests really add to the understanding of who you are, as a Tenno                  The devs have a great sense of humour, the redtext update notices are arguably the most loved part of this game You should try get some of your friends to play with you when you're still early game. It's a lot more fun to play as a team and learn how the game works. To this day I still play with the person who I got into the game at MR1, and, as a result of us learning how to do things together, we can take on almost any mission as just the two of us. Content is constantly being added, and the environment is always changing. You have been playing for over an hour. Please don't forget to take a break. There are many frames to choose from, but Don't get your view stuck on one frame. You may find that another one suits you more. This game will teach you more about farming than Farming Simulator. You can get Plat by selling excess Prime Parts. The Warframe Wikia site is very helpful, Often even higher-level players will go to the wiki to check the drop chance of a certain part, or where to go to farm another part, pros and cons of a certain frame to decide whether to get it, and so on. You have been playing for over an hour. Please don't forget to take a break. The game runs well on almost anything, and looks really good even on medium. Often you'll find yourself absorbed in the game, as there is so much to do: Time-based mission alerts for those hard-to-get resources and special items, Invasions that allow you to choose a faction, which then will give you exclusive resources for your support, Prime items are on a constant cycle of release and vault, meaning there's still stuff to get. You have been playing for over an hour. Please don't forget to take a break. CLEM! GRAKATA!  Overall, this is a great game, and the fact that it's F2P makes it at the very top of my list of All-Time favourites. Highly Recommended.",Recommended,2017.12.14,6.0

Warframe,PraxDev,"Product received for free  Warframe still the greatest game for me after 10 years of Free to play development. Warframe has been a stable support in my life during good and bad times to keep me sane and away from trouble. Its great to play with friends and you can spend hours on the game without getting bored. The game provides challenging content for the more ""Elite"" players that have time to waist. The game development has a focus on new player experience which makes it easy to help friends start out.  After a year of not playing the game I came to back to earn some lost time and it wasn't disappointing to say the lest. Game has changed a lot some good some bad, but the pros out way the cons for old players. Dev team is still interactive with community and regular patches and fixes. Content updates seasonal and keeps you busy for months on end.  For new players that would like to try the game I say ""Go for it!! You got nothing to lose!!"".  (Semi - Player driven economy) Players have the option to spend money in game (no real advantage in game to other players), but still have the option to work for the items they want by farming items and goodies of all sorts to trade with other players to gain Platinum currency. Platinum is the premium currency you get when you spend money in game. Player driven economy drives a lot of players away due to other game experiences. Platinum is mostly used for cosmetics and trading with other players.  For the content there is a lot to take in for new players. Even with the large amount of content you wont feel pushed to do something so you can take your time and learn the game while having fun. Many guides on the internet to view and plenty of videos and players willing to help Starting the game of with a friend at your level is a good idea since you can help each other. If you have a friend that has played Warframe for a long time you are in luck. Experience is a good thing in Warframe, but its a double edged Nikana waiting to happen. Play the game at your own pace and enjoy it. Before long you will be a strong player and a great team mate.

Warframe,Aran,"Played 2600 hours in around 3 years.  Can't. Stop. Playing.  I can't even stop thinking about the game outside the game. I'm probably working or preparing breakfast and have a past Devstream or analysis about it running on my cellphone.  Every Warframe you can use is unique. There's a ton of weapons that i haven't seen in other MMO's and playing with friends is a blast.  Warframe is an F2P game where you can grind the cash currency (platinum) and never spending a single penny on it. (And even if you need to, you'll probably get discounts in game) and this is awesome, because customization mostly comes from cash items. And customization in warframe is super complete. (also our true endgame)  Lastly: you have freedom. You can build your characters and weapons any way, and you'll always be able to rearrange and change everything whenever you want. You don't have to always play the same character because is the only one you leveled up. You don't have to start from the complete bottom if you wanna play something else. You don't have to do the same quests and the same missions again with another warframe. You just swap, and continue fighting.  Try it, and if you have problems progressing, ask in the region chat. Most people in the community will be happy to help you.  UPDATE: I just crossed the 10 years line in October 2023. The game is better than ever. I PLAYED THIS 10 YEARS ALMOST NON-STOP.

Warframe,🌸 幻 | Valinypse,"Comentario Analítico: ""Warframe""  Warframe es un Looter Shooter multijugador (Mayormente PvE) en tercera persona con un fuerte énfasis en el parkour, la acción frenética y diversidad de kits de habilidades.  Si bien la dinámica no va más allá del constante grindeo, la acción está tan bien ejecutada que resulta gratificante repetir una misma quest infinidad de veces, acompañado o en solitario, a distancia o melee, de manera sigilosa o a lo rambo. Todo Warframe está construido alrededor del grindeo, es parte de la aventura y de la finalidad, y se nota en cuán refinada está para tratarse de un juego en activo desarrollo desde 2013 y con una comunidad enorme y muy activa a más de una década posterior a su estreno.  Hasta la fecha maneja un modelo de monetización muy sano, no hay necesidad de gastar dinero para obtener acceso a tal cantidad de contenido de calidad, nada de paywalls, los ingresos que Warframe genera nacen de cosméticos o compras que pueden realizarse con dinero del juego. El único punto donde se beneficia al adinerado es en relación al espacio del inventario, que no es una necesidad estricta pero sí se vuelve tentador cuanto más avances, no obstante se puede ganar hasta Platinum simplemente jugando.  Tiene momentos sorprendentes en lo que a visuales respecta, en especial si destacamos que se trata de un juego del 2013 corriendo en Evolution Engine, y además la historia va ganando fuerza más allá de lo que a principio pareciera ser un mero juego de ninjas espaciales.

Warframe,NSGuy,"I have quit for like a year and came back to playing. I unlocked almost EVERYTHING before I left and did sorties good and well. After I came back I learned all the relays are locked for me and I cannot do sorties without this 1 relay being unlocked for a quest that I felt like I already did(cause it sounded familiar). At least I guess it makes me stop being lazy and work for something instead of 1 shotting everything with my prime dual swords. Still kinda saddened that the quests to unlock the relay are boring and easy to do, except the one boss mission. Never have I ever faced a more cancer boss fight ever. Not only did I do NO DAMAGE. vs him, HE HEALS THE DAMAGE YOU DO BACK. Had to get help to even do it cause I ran out of amo the first try. His hitbox is too tiny and he moves too much for you to be able to hit him. If all bosses are like him then im just gonna never play again cause his fight was near impossible to do. This is from someone who has had over 200 hours played previously in the game, who could do sorties, but not anymore. If your comin back from a long break just say no to doing that 1 relay boss fight mission, its cancer alone and hardly bearable with someone(note I did use a bow).",Recommended,2016.04.27,564.0

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Warframe,Skeeb23,"I would like to review a couple of aspects of this game that I wanted to know about before playing. Hopefully this will help others too:  1. Grind People hear the word grind and that instantly gives you a very negative thought about a game. I have read many reviews on this game and they all talk about ""grind."" What I think some fail to mention, however, is that the word grind is a different meaning in this game. Yes you need to get resources and farm for blueprints and all of that. Guess what though... it is actually very fun to do that. Now, this is just my opinion, I get it, but many others I think would also agree. The grind is necessary unless you just want to log in and get everything in your first 10 hours. Is that fun? Is that even a challenge? No. This game makes this grind very good because the actual gameplay is fantastic. I've played many RPG's and many MMO's... and many shooters... I already have logged over 20 hours and I just started playing this just a few days ago. So yes, it is fun.  2. Is this an MMO? This was the other thing that made me not want to try this game. I am kinda burnt out on MMO's atm. I have played many many MMO's over the years. I would not call this game an MMO. It has MMO elements, but its how you want to play it. You can go solo, group with friends or drop into the shared world servers. All of that is option and playstyle. Yes I admit you may need some help along the way to get some of the things you want to have, but honestly I'm good with that. Because then I can go right back to being solo or co-op as I please.  Hopefully those two points hit on questions you may have. I know they are both questions I had. I have hesitated to play this game for a couple of years now... but millions of players and many very positive reviews can't all be wrong.  I would also highly recommend searching for this game on Youtube. There are many great reviews on this game for both positive and negative points to help you decide.",Recommended,2018.07.13,61.5

Warframe,Neo,"Great game, probably my favourite game on steam all things considered. Was close to having enough of Destiny 2 and needed a break, so this game was suggested. Discovered Warframe in 2017. Just dismissed it as another ""free to play game"" previously and never gave it a second look.  Plays great, huge variety of missions, countless weapons and frames to farm for parts, build, and use. Or, if you like you can use the games currency to buy these things (or the blueprints for them) to save some time. Nothing is ever out of reach though and now that I understand the mechanics a little better, theres no real need to spend any money in this game (unless you want to).  I made one major purchase which was the Hydroid prime pack (which came with more Platinum than I thought I'd ever need). As of today I've still got 250 Plat left. I'm very happy I did this as it gave me more options without taking away from the grind. I probably spent most of the plat on boosters and cosmetics to be fair.  Only real criticism I have for this game is that there isn't a lot of (in-game) direction. The community is great though and I've never had a questions go unanswered in chat.  If I were to sum this game up I would say it's similar to Destiny 2, but the developers actually care.",Recommended,2018.02.20,101.5

Warframe,Sir Charles <Huntmaster> [TH-II],"Update Autumn 2024: Its pretty good by now. Most issues adressed in my earlier rewievs have been adressed. Early game content was never a problem to begin with, now there also is decent late game content. The game is still lacking a real challenge for well-equipped players, but thats not an issue since the loot-cycle has gotten a lot better. I can happily recommend it now.  Update January 2022: They realeased ""The New War"" now, an update that was announced and hyped up (by the Devs i mean, not the community) for years. The update brought a new quest, 2 new weapons (one of them can be considered good) and many skins, thats it. The quest was 5 hours of showing what the Devs CAN do, then releasing you back into a game thats unchanged since 2015 or so, left with more disapointment than ever. Not a single promising element from the quest stayed after you finished it. Worst thing is the quest is not even replayable yet (will problably be in the future tho). Conclusion: unchanged.  Update Summer 2020: Tennocon 2020 was the Devs chance to prove they can do better. They teased something important and killed it off before it was even released. They have clearly proven now they can not do better. This game is not going in a good direction. Stay away if you want to save yourself some frustration!   Original Review:  Don't get me wrong: The first 600-1000 hours are fun, really fun.  But once you have gone through the content, it will become extremely frustrating. The game is very addicting and you will want to play. Unfortunately you will realize that the developers will not meet your expectations and you will slowly start to love the game, but hate the Devs. Try it if you want, but I recommend you rather spend your time on something that is not as disappointing on the long term.  The community is pretty nice btw, as long as you like the game. People tend to be extremely toxic towards other games though, which makes perfect sense with what i stated above.  I would love to change this review to positive one day btw., but for that to happen the Devs need to actually listen to feedback...",Recommended,2020.04.03,3.0

Warframe,Mental1ty,"I had a review before, but I felt like its time to completely redo it, now that I am more experienced.  So, we have Warframe. What is warframe? You are a Tenno, basically a space ninja-samurai-thing, and you have to restore balance to the galaxy. By that, you go around killing different factions, gathering their resources, to build more weapons to kill them all again. It's a loop, and if you don't like the gameplay or grinding, than this game has nothing for you. There is a tiny amount of story, but the game revolves around gameplay heavily.  So, what are the three factions? -Grineer, an empire of cloned soldiers, who are genetically decaying, and who you'll probably be fighting the most. They are heavily armored, and prefer brute force. -Corpus, a conglomerate of merchants, who do whatever they can for a profit. They have armored helmets, but are mostly lightly armored, and they prefer to use robots and other tricks. -Infested, space zombies. They are infected by a virus from an old war, and kill whatever gets in their way. They are lightly armored, and usually swarm you. There are also the Orokin, but they just take some units from all three factions, and combine them all, which you'll be facing in the Orokin Towers, where you'll be spending most of the endgame.  There are also a multitude of weapons. Some of them are better than others. For example, the Soma and the Soma prime spew crits like crazy. The Boltor Prime does pure damage, and the Latron Prime is very accurate, and very ammo efficient. There are constant wars over which is better, but it usually boils down to personal preferance. Modding can be a bit tricky to get used too, but there are builds online, and it's not too hard to learn.  There are also Warframes, which is basically your class. They al lhave different stats (Health, Shield, Armor, Movement speed, and others), and different powers, which reflect what their based of (Necromancer, assassin, paladin, etc.) They take a while to farm, and 3 days to craft, but some completely change your playstyle compared to others.  So, what about the gameplay? As you are a space ninja thing, you have a large amount of abillities, which include: Wallrunning, rolling, lots of melle attacks, wallrunning and shooting, sliding, sliding and shooting, slide melee attacks, and some others. You use all your abillities, weapons, and powers, along with three other Tenno, to run around maps, and kill everyone in sight.  You've probably also seen it was free to play, so you're wondering ""Is this game Pay2Play?"" Well, my answer is a complete NO. Th eonly things you can get with only the premium currency (platinum) are cosmetic items, and you can get platinum from trading, so anything is available with dedication. All the game changing items are available for free.  The community is great. Aside from some heated arguments (Boltor Prime vs. Soma Prime), they answer questions, are generally polite, and if you need help with a quest, want to do a tower, etc., ask in recruting chat, and they will probably help.  So, this game all boils down to personal preference. Do you prefer the combat? Play it. Do you prefer grinding? Play it. Do you prefer a great story? Not the best game for you. I personally love this game, and I recommend you give it a try. If you don't like it, no money lost. If you love it, you are going to be spending lots of time on it. I've almost spent 400 hours, and that pales in comparison to some of my friends.",Recommended,2013.07.27,577.6

Warframe,Jake_Likes_Chicken,"Warframe is my most played game on steam right now and I have been playing it for over two years. I have experienced a lot of the updates and all of them bring something to the table. We are always left asking for more and anticipating the next update to beat the last. Warframe has a wide array of characters and playstyles to try out. I have played nearly all of them and they are all on their own level of diversity. Out of all of the characters I cannot say that any of them are bad. Every single Frame has a unique ability to bring to a firefight. With a wide array of options to choose a Frame anyone can play this game the way they would like.  DISCLAIMER: At the start of the game you are given three Warframe's to choose one from BUT you are not limited to these. You will choose one of those three but have another Warframe slot in your inventory. This means you can make another Warframe (or if you choose to you can buy one but why would you spend money on a game you have just started playing). In order to get more of these slots you need to spend 20 platinum. At the start of the game you are given 50 plat meaning you can buy two slots for a total of four Warframes right off the start.  As for the platinum: The paid currency, I would like to explain it here. Platinum is a currency that you can buy if you choose, but it gives you no advantage over other players. My preferred method of getting platinum is the alternative to buying it yourself. There is a trade market in the game in which you can trade your items for other items, or you can trade and buy with platinum. If you manage to get a rare item that people would like to have you can exchange it for platinum. There is no reason to ever need to buy platinum. As I had stated before: buying platinum puts you in no advantage over others. As every Warframe has something to provide for the team, buying a new one does not mean that your previously owned one is useless. Every Frame has its own use, meaning that buying a new one does not put you above others. One of the things I hear all of the time is that the game has a Pay 2 Win feature but when I tell them that the item they are looking for can just be found [here] they act suprised as they had not even bothered to look. They saw a price tag and assumed that it was premium content they could only purchase. That mentality is usually what I see from people with that opinion of Warframe.  Now I would like to talk about the early game player experience. This has gone under fire quite a bit recently and I would like to address it. There is a problem with new players trying to pick up the game. There is not a lot of tutorial information to show you what you need to do right away. But we are not the only people who realize this. Digital Extremes are very active towards their players desires. They are currently working on a new system to help this problem. While they are doing that they are also expanding the Guides of the Lotus. The Guides are players who dedicate themselves to helping new players become more familiar with Warframe and what it has to offer. They assist people with all things: general questions, missions, or even help loot grind if neccessary. This used to be a drafted group of people but now that applications were accepted it will be expanding greatly. I, for one, have submitted an application and hope to be accepted. Me and countless others believe the game is worthwhile enough to help new players like the game for what it offers instead of being turned away by the vast amount of information being thrown at you too quickly to comprehend. In short, all games have their shortcomings and Warframe's development team actively tries to fix those as they become apparent. Their are many different measures taking place to deal with this current problem and in the past they have had the same approach. If there is any game that has potential for the future, even after so much idealistic success, it would be Warframe",Recommended,2016.01.24,3.0

This game is repetitive and grindy but if you let yourself get sucked in you will find yourself playing countless hours on it. The one gripe I had is that it seems to lack an overall objevive. However, it really hit home for me after my fourth mission that this really is all about the spectacle and enjoying it. You beat missions to acquire better weapons and power ups only to use them to repeat the process. But when you eventually find yourself flying sideways down a hallway scoring headshots with a weapon you have built and colored yourself while impaling other enemies on an equally personalize sword you have no choice but to stop for a second and say: ""Yes.

Warframe,GEAR BLASTA MALE,"The game that got me into steam, back in 2013, even as barebones as it was back then. Warframe is a 3rd person PvE (Mainly) game about being a space ninja progressing through a solar system becoming more powerful and acquiring loot and gear.  The Good: Incredible graphics and sound design in most places, especially for a free game Vast variety of completely unique weapons and warframes (classes) to choose from (about 300 weapons including variants, and over 40 warframes) Insane amount of content. I have 1600 hours and still have hundreds more hours to do, none of which require money Great community. The odd toxic player but vast majority of players i've met are friendly, kind and will help new players for no reward. Tonnes of map variety, ranging from huge open areas in space, underwater tanks with fish, ancient derelict ships, icy planets, mining colonies, the huge Plains of Eidolon, trading hubs, player built and designed dojos, and more. Huge amount of quests, some of which being some of the best narrative experiences I've ever had in my gaming history, with plenty more down the line Once you get to it, the storyline and lore of warframe is amazing (imo) it's so in depth and interesting, with loads more still to emerge. It's not all clear in game, but much like dark souls, bits can be pieced together. The recent update dropped some major story bombs so hopefully another new quest will be out at some point. In-depth, meaningful customisation of weapon abilities. Unfortunately, most weapons have a clear best build, but many still have several different builds to choose from.                       Overall though the game being free means that it is still worth checking out if you like mmos, quests, looting, good looking games with tonnes of customisation etc etc. Graphics and sound: Gameplay : Story : Lack of grind : Overall : Definitley worth checking out.  I ended up spending lots of money on this game because I like the devs so much that I don't even mind. Their company was on the brink of collapse before this game and they turned it around ez.

Warframe,ToothyPnX,"A decade has swiftly passed as comming from xbox , and looking back at Warframe's evolution is remarkable. What started as a unique blend of third-person shooter and hack 'n' slash has blossomed into something far greater, all without costing a dime.  Warframe's combat system, with its remarkable freedom of movement and flexibility, initially captivated me and has held my attention since. Few games can compare to the experience it offers.  Over the years, Warframe has amassed a wealth of content, providing endless opportunities for exploration, questing, gear crafting, and conquering ever tougher foes. Yes, it can get grindy, and yes, it can become repetitive, but the beauty of Warframe lies in its ability to let you switch things up.  If you're considering trying out Warframe, here's some advice:  Resist the urge to rush through early content. Take your time, savor the sights, and appreciate the details. Optimization and leveling can come later.  Team up with a friend. While you may not do everything together initially, having a partner can help catch things you might have missed. Alternatively, go solo; it's entirely manageable.  Don't skip the tutorial messages. They may seem straightforward, but they hold valuable nuggets of information that will prove beneficial later on.  At a certain point, you'll have two choices. Do you want a natural progression through the story? Opt for the Warframe Path. If you're eager to dive into the deep end and experience mid to end-game gear and mechanics, choose Duviri. My strong recommendation is the former path.",Recommended,2023.09.11,9.0

Warframe,Bonnie the Bunny,"I recommend this game because it's content is original, it's gameplay is fun and intuitive, it's idea is unique. The gunplay is satisfying, the parkor is an active element of the game and very fun, and the sheer scope of the armory is impressive at the least.  I do NOT recommend this game because the developers are lackluster at times, turning back on promises and leaving content lacking or less than it could be. Player suggested content goes by the waysaid, fan creations are gutted, and good ideas are left half constructed and severely lacking.  Overall, this game holds my heart dear with an even array of love and barbed wired, cutting and healing in almost equal measure, but a measure so high I can't help but keep coming back regardless. I've spent quite a lot of my hard earned money on this game (Usually buying the premium currency after a quality or worth while update), and I don't regret it, but it wasn't necessary. ...Mostly. Digital Extremes has a habit of doing some arm bending when it comes to ""encouraging"" players to buy platinum with intense grinds for new equipment. Some times I feel it is necessary due to a lack of other players playing content that otherwise requires some intense min maxing to accomplish.  Overall I recommend this game because it is free, it's well made, and it's fun. But beware that there are barbs among the flowers with a little more bite than expected.",Recommended,2020.12.16,5.0

Warframe,Riven is Best Waifu,"I have a couple of hours in this game.  ""Free to play"" is usually a phrase that inspires some degree of reluctance, and it usually begs the question ""Alright, where are the micro-transactions this time?"" And yes, the game does have micro-transactions - it is free to play, after all. But this premium currency can also be traded, meaning if you farm valuable items, you can trade them off for premium currency without spending a dime.  And to be fair, I have spent money on the game - but my motivations were doing so were motivated by gratitude I felt toward the developers for building a solid and fun game (for reference, I made my first purchase at about 1000 hours in, around the time of my birthday). Digital Extremes truly has their heart in this game, and they truly value the opinions of the players; this is evident in the community involvement they strive to maintain in order to hear player feedback.  For people who like the looter shooter genre, Warframe is good fun. Sure, it has steep as hell learning curve, inadequate in-game explanation, lacks in substantial world building, but it makes up for this in its incredible movement and combat system - both of which make you feel like an overpowered space ninja god - as well as incredible graphics that handle well on potatos, and above all, a stellar community.  If you haven't played it, I'd recommend giving it a good try - once you catch on to the gameplay loop, it can be pretty good fun. And if you have played it and left for a while: there's always now to feel like a space ninja god again.",Recommended,2019.07.03,6.0

Warframe,an.ru.ca,"Warframe is a great coop pve type of shooter. Over the years is has changed much and continues to change. If you are looking for a game to play between games give Warframe a run sometime you may like it. The good: Every weapon and or cosmetic can be earned without spending a dime, provided they are not tennogen stuff. Player made steam workshop vanity items. The community for this game is friendly and you will easily find someone to help you out. It is updated every year with new content and continues to grow. Graphical fidelity has improved a lot since the game's start back in 2012. If you are a graphical junkie you will like this and know it will keep upgrading it's visual look and appeal as it ages. Tons of Warframes,weapons quite a selection of companions to choose from too. Over a dozen game modes to play. Fun with friends and focus on PVE. Ofcoarse it is free to play. Interesting Sci-fi Fantasy story and lore for those who prefer that and not just gameplay. Playing a mission and completing it in under 5 minutes feels rewarding. Good if you are restricted on time from daily life. On PC you can receive a discount on your next purchase of Platinum ingame currency. Good when your pockets are crying.  The Bad: While the community is good they are sometimes slow and or do not accept changes in gameplay or new mechanics. There is PVP in the game but hardly any one plays it, along with the Lunaro game mode which is like a sport type of pvp. Bugs and simple features can take years to be fixed due to the way the game evolves. No hand holding good for those gamers who prefer not to be riddled with tutorials. Bad for those players who prefer a straight explaination of all the ingame systems. Thus you will need someone to guide you through on how the game works. You can still take your time with it on your own pace. Early on you are limited on what slots you have for characters and weapons. Timegate on crafting and unlocking content requiring you to wait from 1-12 hours or at most 3 days to build something. Bad for those who want things right away. You can choose to rush it but that costs play platinum currency bought with real cash. This game will eat a lot of your time. If you cannot spend the time to learn the mechanics or you are unwilling to spend a hundreds of hours of playing. This game is not for you.  I have played this game since closed Beta and still find it interesting to get back to it and take it for a spin. Hopefully this review has given you an insight if this game is for you. Those are my 2 cents on the matter. Happy gaming to you dear reader!",Recommended,2018.11.27,6.0

Sure the game has flaws and it will never satisfy everyone, but the love and dedication that was put into this game is felt with each update that comes out. Digital Extreme are my favourite developers for they created this master piece that later became my favourite game.

Warframe,Gumbercules007,"- I am a Grand Master Founder for Warframe.  Warframe over the years it has had many updates that changes core mechanics all with the intent of improving the game. - They overhauled the whole movement system - They have added in Quest Mission in to the Codex (most are really good) - They have now added fully open world map sets to play in. No longer are you stuck in a small corridor. - They have overhauled the melee system.  Warframe is a Free to Play game done right in my eyes I spend money in the game as I am enjoying my time in the game. Not because I feel I have to.  - In Nov 2018 I came back from a 3 year break in Warframe after The Fortuna update (U24) And WOW has the game changed and all for the better. I am having a blast in the game.  I would recommend this game.  - Nov 2019 Came back after a 7ish month break. This time to build my Railjack. The stand out changes are: - Melee 3.0 (still getting used to it not sure I like it) I really liked using melee as a primary weapon and the loss of channeling really hurt my build. - You can now self evac in a endless mission (I have not done this myself but asked about it.)  Outside that the game still feels the same the people I have played with are for the most part nice and friendly when you ask questions to ""get caught up""  I would and still do recommend this game.",Recommended,2018.11.23,1.0

Warframe,Goosmo,"Pros: - Alot of content. - Fun and smooth fastpaced movement and gameplay. - Lots and lots of different weapons with many having unique gimmicks. - Surpisingly a decent story - Addictive grind. There's just something about that makes you want to keep coming back. - Constantly evolving and updating. You can tell that the develepors put alot of love and effort into the game. - Beautiful graphics and enviroments. - Not at all p2w, you can get everything for free. They aren't forcing you to pay, they are kindly asking for your money. I only spent money on cosmetics and i still have alot of leftover to buy more with the games premium currency. - Premium currency can be traded - Good develepors with good personalities.  Cons: - Desperate need of a proper endgame. Once you're powerful enough, everything in this game will be easy for you. Difficulty will be replaced with how fast you can complete a mission. - After around thousand hours more or less, you will feel the content drought, i know i said this game keeps getting updates, but there are times where you feel there isn't enough. But that's probably because you put too much time in the game, and besides, you have to spent alot of hours to get to this point. - Repetitive. You will spent most of the time going through the same levels, i can understand why the grind wouldn't be for everyone, but i personally ended up liking it. - Bad newplayer experience. After the tutorial, the game puts you out in a strange unfamiliar universe, expecting you to know what to do. The game will not hold your hand, and it won't tell you what to do next. You are pretty much left alone with no clue, luckily, the community is friendly enough to guide you.  I have a friend who's kinda dumb, and couldn't even figure out the basics even though the game told him in the tutorial. He got alot of help figuring out the game, but it still feels like a miracle that he was able to understand all these different mechanics. Perhaps the game isn't that difficult to get into, even then, it's still worth trying, and hey it's free.",Recommended,2018.11.22,1.0

They always fix 2 things they should have fixed 4 years ago, and then break 20 working thing to do it. I don't like children, that's bad on me, but being forced to play one is bad on them. I see the Lotus and her big bulging t^ts, and then back at my 12 year old boy bodied female, and ask why aren't they smart enough to sell puberty on the market?  I also don't understand why auction houses have existed for years in the MMO community, yet this game fails to bring it to us, and it's one of the bigger flaws that needs to be taken care of.  Vaulting, is annoying yes it presents oppurtunity. But it also takes away from new players and collectors, who don't want to spend a billion platinum on a ember prime.

Warframe,Kitsune,"Ah Warframe. For the past 3 weeks this is all i have played, it is a free 2 play game done correctly. Story is odd at first but gets good later on and drags you into it with good twists and great cinimatics with a BEAUTIFUL soundtrack. Gameplay is fun, grindy, but you dont really mind the grind to much. Warframes feel unique and fun to use, and weapons do as well. This game makes you feel like a total badass, being able to wall run while shootng, doing flips, sliding on ziplines, it feels like so much fun. This game also caters to every playstle and i GUERENTEE there is a warframe for you out there. If you want to full stealth a map you can, if you want to set off every alarm, you can do that. Meele combat doesnt feel like a stale spam fest, it feels like that at the start, but once you learn how to use stance cards, it feels like something like for honor or a good fighting game, the combos feel fluid and look good. The wide selection of weapons and frames is great, but even grater is the coustemization you can do in this game. This game is nick named ""fashionframe"" and i can see why. There are coupious amount of colors, helmets, skins, effects, and even followers you can change. I digress though.

Warframe,Kyne,"I found Warframe a couple years ago after a friend decided to show me while visiting his house. At the time I could not play it due to my computer being a horrible HP laptop. Fast forward about two years after that, I have a great gaming rig. I decided Warframe would be one of my top of the list must plays, and so I download and play a little. The first account I made was kind of a bust. When you enter into Warframe I suggest having some good prior knowledge as to how the game works. Having a friend who knows their way around would be just as good, if not better. Another account is made not long after that account and after a while I would say I am doing rather well for myself. This game is actually really addicting if you are into RNG and grinding out some missions. The quests getting released every now and then get increasingly interesting. Especially with the last TennoCon things are changing, possibly for the better. I would definitely recommend this game to a person with a lot of time on their hands, at the same time try to find a friend who enjoys this type of game just as much.

Warframe,Connor Lol,"Product received for free  This game is ASTONISHING for being free. The vast amount of content one can do WITHOUT having to spend a single cent is remarkable! The things that you can only get with platinum (the paid currency) include most cosmetics and color palettes. But even then, you can trade certain resources with other players for platinum. Every single weapon and Warframe can be obtained for FREE.  The Duviri Paradox quest is BEAUTIFUL and ambitious, I am so glad they opened it to newer players. It gave my friends a chance to see what outstandingly fun content the later stages of Warframe holds. Frankly, the amount of content that is given to you as a new player is highly limited and linear. The Duviri Paradox gives a nice little snippet of what is to come for newbies by allowing a rotation trial for weapons and Warframes that you dont own.  The gameplay is smooth and exciting. The movement certainly does not hold you back from flying through the air or barreling down corridors. This mobility coupled with the fast gunplay and brutal melee combat is just so satisfying. Wide arrays of weapons ensure that there are multiple ways to mercilessly tear down hordes of enemies, or precisely take out a VIP target silently. There's a huge variety of mission types to keep this gameplay fresh, ranging from stealth sections to full on boss battles.  The last point I want to leave you with is if you're interested in this game, play it with a friend!

Warframe,ily,"Warframe, oohh Warframe, I cannot tell you how many times I've wanted to quit this game but I've just never had the intent too after thinking about it. This game is honestly the most fun game I've played in a long time. The game is quite balanced and works completely fine in my humble opinion. Yes most definetely it is a very repetetive game, but it's free after all, what did you expect from a high quality Sci Fi 3rd person shooter? The amount of grinding in this game is crazy, but its worth it, once you get away from the begginer phase aka the MR5 curse, you begin to have a completely new look at the game, you've finished the star chart and finally learned how relics work, you've obtained your first Prime and possibly even learned about Lua Drift Mods and the puzzle rooms. There is alot this game hides that you can't see, and it's darn rewarding when you unock those stages of the game. I've been playing since 2015 and has had alot of fun playing the game, I'm currently cursed by this very underpowered ASUS laptop and I'm unable to play warframe for the time being, until I finally get enough money to buy a decent computer to start my grind again. There are some major things that i dont like about this game tho.  And one of those things is the Foundry, I honestly hate it when im building cypher's for a spy mission because i suck at hacking corpus coms. So i have to babysit the foundry for around 6 minutes to build 6 cyphers, and dont even get me started on the amount of nitain some things need to be built, or obtaining vanilla Vauban, some of the things in this game or a pain in the arse to get but its rewarding in the end.  Sadly i am unable to get Excalibur Prime, as he was one of the frames back in the old days of Warframe that was included in the Founders Pack. I would love to see him make a comeback one day or a reward for possibly 1000 days played? But then again we don't deserve it, the people who got him do, they poured money into the game and helped the develepors make the game we know today as Warframe, so please thank every person you know that has an Excal Prime.  Overall im very happy with the product and ill be looking forward to playing this game again, it's been a blast writing this review as i get to explain my feelings for this game.

Grinding from the beginning through the end but once you start getting some stuff you just get addicted to it.  3. Never convert platinum into credits. and use the starting plat to buy slots. You can earn plat in-game through trading rare items. Credits are easily obtainable and you will have a huge surplus of them after some time.  4. Dont always run after prime parts.

Warframe,Android Girl Supremacist 🤖,"warframe... i havent been playing it for that long only 200h at the time of this review but i must say that i am hooked to it so badly. The game is basically a looter, shooter, ninja game and a fast paced at that  Cons: 1. Wallet Warrior Problems platinium is way too expensive this is my complaint about it cause damn 75 plat for 5 bucks damn thats expensive  2. Tutorial the tutorial is kinda bad well it could be better it guides you trough basic combat doesn't really give you any tips on the ""advanced"" stuff for example movement they only tell you how to bullet jump crouch wall jump and so on which most are done simply by tapping the spacebar and then theres the whole mods thing which is barely touched upon which i reminf you is pretty much the most complicated part of the game  3. Limited Room limited room to play in warfrane is an instance based game you have a set map you can wander in kill enemies and do the objective i personally like this but some may not so it's kinda a pro and a con depends on the people  4. PVP The PVP aka Conclave really feels unbalanced i mean you can go as a total noob who just started the game against max mastery rank players who have thousands of hours invested in it. so matchmaking pls and being able to switch teams would be lovely.  Pros: 1. NOT pay2win even though most people think so warframe is NOT a Pay2Win game, everything is obtainable if you play the game... imagine that actually get things for playing the game no paywalls or anything wow.  2. Awesome Graphics on low-end PCs Warframe runs really well on low end systems it looks really good but reguires hardly any hardware to run it well thats what i have experienced  3. The Dev Team Awesome devs who care about the game and keep it balanced excluding pvp (thats my opinion at least) they add new content to the game all the time.  4. Community The community where can i start well IT IS THE LEAST TOXIC COMMUNITY EVER SEEN (so sorry for the caps but they were needed). the people are so nice trading is fluent to some extent concerning the community at least and well you cant really even be a bad person here to go to the higher levels or end game you need to work as a team if you are toxic you will gain bad reputation and nobody wants to play with you anymore.",Recommended,2016.04.14,2.0

Gameplay is on the high level.Here you can jump, run , slide and roll , and combine methods to quickly move through the level and avoid enemy fire.(This is that i like so much).

Warframe,Krion,"Warframe has always been an odd game for me to recommend to friends because it's such an unusual game. It's kind of a first of its kind in terms of what it does, with only perhaps games like Phantasy Star Online 2 and Monster Hunter sharing close similarities.  The game has ARPG elements in how you farm and progressively work on improving your builds with a truly large spectrum of mods for both your warframe, your companion and your weapons. At the same time though unlike most ARPGs, in this game you aren't farming to get a random drop of weapons and armor but rather the materials with which you build your weapons and warframes. This is done in this way because once you get a weapon after crafting it, that weapon is going to be yours forever, and every other player that crafts that same weapon will have the same stats. It means that any customization on weapons comes from these mods you equip onto it. I really like this system because most of the customization and personalization is moved onto mods as opposed to having to hope you will get a random drop of a weapon you really want with the perfect stats (like you do in Diablo).  This brings us to the next point which is that Warframe has a rich economy system, that can be most closely related to oldschool MMOs where trading resources was essential. You can make real money currency by selling mods or rare blueprints for weapons, which for those of you that enjoy that type of gameplay, you're in for a treat. It's nowhere near EvE levels but ironically compared to most modern MMOs where economy is all but dead with almost everything being attached to soulbound and personal loot, in Warframe there is truly a wide variety of things you can trade to make profit.  I could go on to explain to you how the gameplay is fast paced and exciting and yet how there are always bugs with every big new update that releases for the first 1-2 weeks, etc etc. But I think that a lot of that you will discover yourself. It's I think a game best played and tried out by yourself, because it can be a bit jarring for new players who get barraged with information from veteran players about what things like endo, kuva, sorties, relics and a bunch of other things that you will eventually learn and understand. For now if you feel like being a space ninja in an instanced 4 person co-op mission format, yet at the same time a game world with a rich economy and very social playerbase, try out Warframe! You won't regret it!  Edit: They just added their 2nd open world environment which takes place on Venus and it's about 3x bigger than the one from last year, not to mention that future plans include being able to take off planets and go into open space where you can use all previously crafted systems like archwing, to fight against enemy battleships.

Warframe,Sarklor,"Warframe is really freaking fun.  Imagine a good 4-player co-op game like Left 4 Dead. Now make it 3rd person, and add in a whole load more weapons, from magnums to assault rifles to boomerangs with spikes. And give those weapons a levelling option so you can add in extra traits like elemental damage, increased ammor or fire rate, or scenery penetration. Then to finish off instead of redneck hicks or token female college students, make the player a magical cyberninja. In space.  Gameplay is fast and slick, and your Warframe is very responsive. The core game is a huge amount of hacky-slashy fun, especially with friends. You can play solo and that's enjoyable enough now and then, but the game adds in more and tougher enemies the more players there are, much like Diablo 2 did. You can choose one of three Warframes at the beginning, but there are another ten to collect, which is mostly a matter of completing assassination missions that reward you with the requisite parts. You can spend real world money if you like, but it's genuinely fun to run the same mission a couple of times because the action is pretty intense, and the levels are randomly generated, so surprises do happen.  Play Warframe, it's very enjoyable, and it's free. What more could you want?",Recommended,2014.03.04,5.0
Warframe,AngryAlbinoCroc,"Yes I highly recommend it. It can get a bit repetative, but it can still hold its own for a free game that is not pay to win.  After 1000 hours I can say that I will probably never leave this game. The devs really listen to what the people are saying, and have taken some huge steps to ensure that our needs are met. That being said gameplay is better then ever and the weapon selection is now insanely large.  The grind is still there though you really need to add your face to it if you want to get all the big boy toys.

I can praise the developers, who obviously love the game they create and are fast to bring us the new stuff. I can say that Warframe is the first game that attracted me with its unique style. But the thing that I love the most is the setting lore - well, its scattered parts, which are brought with every new update. The lore is by far the most original thing in the game: how about a well mixed coctail made of space adventures, roman and japanese culture? Don't forget the feeling of waking up in a cryocapsule and realising that there are very few left of your nation, if any, and everyone else in the universe hates you.",Recommended,2014.01.02,1.0

Warframe,Farlander,"Warframe is one of those games that defies its genre, and any other type of catagorization. Warframe really is a game like no other, a shining, unique paradigm of excellence that will surely define gaming for generations.  Obviously, Warframe is a 3rd person shooter, with literally millions of combinations of abilities, guns, and melee weapons to use. However, Warframe is like no other 3rd person shooter I've played. Since you play as ninjas, you can run on walls, tiptoe across ziplines....basically everything short of flying. The mobility and the fast pace of the combat offers an astounding freedom of movement that really needs to be experienced to be properly described.  Warframe is in early access, but make no mistake, this will in no way hinder your enjoyment of the game. The graphics are gorgeous, and the game is relatively bug free, with only occasional, mostly minor issues. The game is also very efficient, so if you have a low end laptop, Warframe will probably run without issues regardless of what you own.  As for the main gameplay loop, currently, the game revolves around gathering components and resources to make new weapons, with a ""mastery"" system as well, which rewards you for basically collect-a-thoning.  Recent additions to the game, however, have included cinematic quests, which have proven that Warframe is as interested in becoming as deep and lore-rich as it is fun to grind.  The developers of this game are nothing short of the best, most dedicated group of people I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Their primary motivation seems to simply be to ensure that Warframe, their masterpiece, is nothing short of the best creation it can possibly be, and they seem to revel in beating the ever increasing expectations their players have for the game.  One needs to only play after a big patch hits to see this. When hotfixes come whizzing in every 5 minutes, with dozens and dozens of bugs being fixed within hours of the release of a new patch, you will understand the meaning of dedication. Warframe is a well oiled machine, at all times, period. The devs will not rest so long as something is afflicting the community.  And of course, the community for Warframe is nothing short of astonishing. Mature, positive people abound in warframe. I don't know what it is about Warframe, but the nicest people in the world seem to play it.  And of course, to address the elephant in the room, Warframe employs the most player friendly business model in the world. Everything in the game, I repeat, EVERYTHING, can be obtained without spending a cent, short of some strictly cosmetic items. Additionally, although Warframe has a fair bit of grinding in it, you won't spend months grinding for new gear, not even the most treasured ""prime"" items in the game. Warframe manages to use a ""pay to have it now, wait to have it for free"" without resorting to the soul crushing, near inifinte grind that many F2P games feature. And, to top it all off, many of the items you can farm are tradable for premium currency, so dedicated players are essentially integrated with the cash shop, so if you want premium skins, you can have them, without spending a dime.  Warframe somehow manages to feature everything gamers of this era crave, while avoiding all the pitfalls and traps so many other games fall into, wittingly or otherwise. Warframe is original and thrilling, but also deep and engaging. Its monetization is nothing if not fair, and its developers will make you question what it means to develop a game.  As I go into my fifth year playing this game, I realize now more than ever, Warframe is not simply a game, it is a journey, one that I will treasure for years to come. It needs to be experienced to be understood, and it will not disappoint.",Recommended,2013.12.22,5.0

The combat is fast and flowing and once you get out of the early game the weapons are punchy and satisfying.

To see Voids, Orokin Derelicts, all the different map types (atleast 7 tilesets), clan dojos (duels and obstacle courses), codexes and Lephantis propably takes atleast 50-100 hours by yourself. F2P model has been improved and especially frames are now a lot easier to obtain (drop rates are good) and there are a lot events that give you plenty of ingame credits. Gameplay is solid and is improved constantly and there are updates pretty much every week.",Recommended,2013.11.28,5.0

Warframe,Fo,"You want to play a good game, but games cost money, so you have to get a job to earn some.  So you go to work every day and work hard to get some money. Depending on a random number generator you get paid up to 0.5 USD per day so you could buy better equipment for doing your job.  After a few months, you realize that the game was free.  Your job was the game. There's no other game.  Would recommend Warframe for people who are tired from their regular job and want another job as a pilot of space-bio-cybernetic robots that do a lot of special effects and explosions when you press Ctrl and E randomly.

Warframe,Yajuu,"So, I will start with a justifacation as to why I will not talk about the aspects of the game. I have over 1000 hours in this. The game has changed vastly since I started in beta - and this many hours in there is no way a person can not be jaded to the full experiance - or for that matter even be able to fathom the game experiance for a new player. Reviews of a game should never be done this far in - you loose perspective.  So here you go  1200 hours on record as of writing this. It was good enough for 1200 hours.  Yes. I would recomend trying it.  Why? Because it is free to play, and I got 1200 hours out of it. The math there was pretty easy. Hell I quit playing because I didn't like the direction it was going. I am still going to recomend it - 1200 hours, free to play.  If you see a review for this game with a thumbs down, and look at that persons time - and it says literally hundreds of hours, and the game is free - Ignore them.

From the moment I stepped into its immersive world, I was blown away by the stunning visuals and the rich, futuristic universe it presents. The attention to detail in the environments and character design is simply remarkable.  The gameplay itself is nothing short of phenomenal. The fast-paced action, fluid movement, and acrobatic combat mechanics make every mission a thrilling and exhilarating experience. Whether I'm slicing through enemies as a nimble ninja or unleashing devastating powers as a powerful space wizard, every moment feels empowering and satisfying.  One of the standout features of Warframe is the depth of customization it offers. The extensive array of Warframes, weapons, and mods allows for endless combinations, ensuring that every player can tailor their playstyle to perfection. The constant updates and additions by the developers keep the game fresh and exciting, always giving me something new to explore and master.  Another aspect I truly appreciate is the supportive and welcoming community. Whether it's teaming up for co-op missions or seeking advice, players are always ready to lend a helping hand. This sense of camaraderie adds a whole new layer of enjoyment to the game.  Warframe truly sets the standard for free-to-play games, providing an incredible amount of content without sacrificing quality. Its mix of intense action, deep customization, and the ever-evolving world keeps me coming back for more.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Warframe,Draennon,"This is easily my most played game of the past decade. It evolved from a 'simple' 3rd person shooter to something so incredibly diverse and expansive that I can only recommend this game to anyone that is interested in 3rd person shooters. The gameplay is super smooth and the monetisation is more than fair. You can literally do everything in the game for free. The only things that I would say ""affect"" the gameplay are slots for more frames and weapons. But since you can trade for the premium currency, you can even get those for free, if you are just patient enough to look for someone to buy the mods or parts you want to trade.  I did spend a fair amount of money on this game, but considering my playtime I definitely say, it is money well spent. Most of it also went into cosmetics.  I did not play any other game that kept me as invested and interested over such a long time as Warframe.

Warframe,DraKKoN,"Warframe is a good game. Almost perfect trade system, good battle system, perfect graphics. Like; 1. Wide range of weapons. 2. Wide range of classes. 3. This game isn't full value rpg, but it's elements are a lot in this game. Every class, every weapon you can improve to higher lvl. 4. Multiplayer is up to 4 guys, but you can play solo. 5. As well as PvE, Warframe has PvP.  Dislike; 1.PvP. PvP system is need to be improved. You can fight only vs 1 guy in your clan (need duel room) and up to 2vs2 in some places in some planets. Balanced by conclave. it's an indicator of your collness. It improves when you getting new, better items.  In all, Warframe is very good game.

Warframe,Lone Traveler,"This game means the world to me. It has helped me through many hard times and has helped me find and build relationships with many people. It has a unique and highly in-depth customization system and stunning game-play. I have seen many reviews recently from people who have played thousands of hours as i have of this game, recommending against it and bad mouthing it. I still find these reviews from these people to be valid, if a bit frustrating. The game itself has numerous issues, and some small but persistent bugs (not including big bugs from major releases that tend to get patched VERY quickly after updates launch), as well as a game-play loop that can be a bit grindy. All of these points are valid, but do not make the sum of the game as a whole, a negative experience. Every game out there has its problems, and while these problems should not be ignored, they are understandable. This is were Warframe, and DE as developers shine, in striving to innovate and improve the experience. DE's dedication to the fans never ceases to amaze me, and they actively care about their game and players, always trying to do whats best for both, even if they sometimes fall short of the mark. My personal recommendation is to enjoy this game for what it is and what it tries to be for its players and to not ignore its flaws but understand them for what they are and not let them undermine the wonderfully and lovingly crafted thing this game is.

Warframe,Mantis,"BEWARE: Wall of text incoming.  First of all: I started playing Warframe like 2 weeks ago, so i'm still kinda new to the whole thing. But i gotta say: I LOVE IT! Warframe is a sci-fi action game that gets the rating AWESOME right at the very beginning of the game: You're a freakin space ninja! And a pretty damn mighty one. The gameplay can be described as somewhat similar to mass effect but focuses a lot more on pure, epic action. It's co-op so you're going to be able to slash through dozens of enemies with your friends, which is pretty great due to the fact that there aren't that many co-ops game out there.  So... let's just look at some pros and cons:  -----------PROS------------------ -Absolutely epic graphics ( i find myself quite often just standing around and enjoying the great visuals)  -Great programming concerning perfomance (you are able to run the game in high details with just a mediocre set-up)  -Exciting fast-paced co-op gameplay  -A whole lot of content (several planets with different mission types, tons of weapons and warframes, extra missions which you can accsess by crafting keys)  -You are able to join and form clans and build clan dojos! (This is a point i'd really like to highlight because the dojos are such a cool feature. Basically you can build all kind of different rooms in your dojo, including labs, duel rooms, obstacle courses, absolutely beautiful decorations rooms with japanese theming, an awesome planetarium and other stuff.)  -Great fluid gamefeel (you can perform several moves like wallrunning, dashing, backflipping and basically everything you'd like to do as a space ninja!)  -completely fair f2p concept (almost everything in the game can be accomplished without spending real money, excluding additional itemslots (that are quite cheap), cosmetical items and items to supercharge your weapons and warframes.)  -The developers are great guys who really give you the feeling that they care about their game. Warframe got so many details and features that the game itself wouldn't necessarily need, but just make it better and more thought out. (The earlier mentioned clandojo is a big example for this!)  - DAT PATCH REDTEXT (if you played the game for a bit, you know what i mean)   After the pros, let's get to the few, but possibly heavy for some people, cons.  -------------CONS---------------- -Warframe is terribly bug-infested. The main chat loves to freeze from time to time, the UI can get stuck, missions won't start and many other problems might appear... I'd say these kind of bugs don't make the game unplayable but sometimes REALLY get on your nerves and take away from your fun. The Devs really gotta do something about that since Warframe is already out for some time and this serious amount of bugs shouldn't be present after that .  -The game gets quite repetitive after a while due to the fact that all of the missions just repeat and the only thing new about each planet is the level tileset and different ressources you are able to obtain there.  -GRIND GRIND GRIND (seriously, the whole game is actually based on grinding and farming ressourses to be able to craft new weapons, warframes and keys to access the orokin missions. This might be a very bad thing depending on the type of player you are. For me personally it's not a big deal since grinding in warframe is freakin fun thanks to its action packed gameplay. In other games i have always lost interest after collecting the 10th kodo wiener...)  Sooo... Here's your TL;DR: Warframe can be a really great game that is full of action, tons of content and give you the feeling that the devs care about us players. On the other hand you might get bored pretty damn fast due to its repetitive gameplay and the amount of grinding you have to do in order to craft new items. Depending on the type of player you are you're going to have TONS of fun with warframe or going to quit after 2 hours saying ""jesus, this is so boring""  Having written all this the only thing left to say is:",Recommended,2014.06.05,101.4

EVERY warframe and EVERY weapon can be acquired without spending a cent. This is where the grinding comes in. You have to have patience, and play the game.

Warframe,Dexx,"Product received for free  I am updating my review as of 2021. I have been playing this game off and on since 2014. There has been a tremendous change since; some good, some bad. So I'll try to give my unbiased opinion even though I am a total fan boy. I will also try my best to simplify everything, so If you have questions I am more than happy to reply.  Review Time:  For the fresh new player, it is super fun for the first few missions. My dad started playing and his words were ""I could play this for hours."" However, after about an hour or two, the Devs really just throw you to the wolves. At this point he lost interest.. a problem much of new players experience unfortunately. The game mechanics are confusing, the weapon mods and character mods can be really hard to understand, such as how weapon damage is increased but at the same time can negatively effect a stat.... or what the hell is a status effect etc.. etc.. Fortunately for the community there are guides and how-to forums and videos all over the place. I still look up walk through's on this game years later. So if you are really willing to learn the game, it isn't impossible.  The upside to this, is seemingly endless content for close to 500 hours, however once you get to end game, it can start to get repetitive. Missions feel the same, content seems lack luster or short once you get to the point where you have everything.  Okay, so it really sounds like I am just totally dogging on this game... But let me be clear. This is a game I played when I was younger. Like... still going to school and pretending to be asleep just to stay up late and play. I've made life long friends on this game. I've lived an entire life with people on here, that I otherwise would have never met. I've seen people come and go throughout this game. I've seen my friends get married, have kids, get great jobs and unfortunately some have passed on. I wouldn't trade any of it for the world. So what I am getting to is.. the community. It is so easy to meet new people. It's an awesome community of people that live and breathe Warframe. People are there to help you, you have a question? Don't be afraid to ask. Someone is there and willing to answer any question you have. The content is there, you can find yourself invested into hours upon hours of gameplay. But the thing that really keeps you going is your friends. Just to talk and kill things. It's awesome.  Long story longer:  Get the game, try it out... talk to some people and just enjoy yourself. It's worth a download. If you want to play and want help. Shoot me a message. I'm always playing and willing to help out any new player I can.

Warframe,Ryugan777,"Warframe may seem like a massive game in which you could spend days into it to grind some gear and loot resources to craft better gear. It would also seem like a game with many possibilities, synergies,maybe too many. It however may look boring as it is often reptitive.  If you are assuming any of this, you are right. It offers lots to do, lots to grind, and it may ask you to do, redo and reredo (...) a lot of missions to acquire what you want.  But if you look at the big picture, you might be able to judge if the game fits you. here are some of the things you can expect from the game: -A style that is yet to be rivaled: Sci-Fi has been done and redone in video games, but combining the aspects of ninjas, space, etc... in such a stable blend is worth many praises. The game is beautiful, and surprisingly, low to mid tier computers can run it at lower graphics, while keeping a good enough visual. A good computer could run it in High graphics, which truly makes it more enjoyable, especially when throwing yourself in the fray, guns blazing and blades slicing. -A simple enough start: Right after a very simple tutorial, you are thrown into the galaxy, ready to take upon the threats of the universe. You might be overwhelmend at first, but failure is not going to hinder you in any way. Enemies grow stronger as the game progresses, at your pace, but so does your equipment. there is a lot to do, so take your time in doing it. -Nearly endless possibilities: the game offers you few weapons and choices to start with, but as you make progress, you will uncover more weapons and warframes to play with. The number of weapons may be overwhelming, but it adds to the true challenge: Trying every single weapon is key to Mastery, which is the equivalent of a General Rank that unlocks you more weapons and quests. Over 400 weapons up for grabs, making up to thousands of different builds for all the styles. But the weapons aren't obtainable with just cash for the most part.. -(Almost) every possibility for free: All the weapons, all the Warframes, all the Upgrades can be acquired via gameplay. Looting enemies, buying blueprints and using the two to craft weapons is the core path to expand your arsenal. You CAN pay real money to buy any frame or weapon, but out of all my hours spent, the only situations where I spent money for stuff I could get for free was to avoid a bit of grind that wasn't very stable (RNG based, too challenging and time spending....). -A Community worth the detour: In all my years, I have never seen a community this tight. You obviously have bad apples, but I made many friends there, and many players are keen on helping others. The Market community would also be a great opportunity for you to acquire some good trades: the premium currency is a tradable ressource, meaning that you could sell the rare parts you loot but don't need against this currency. Buying equipment that couldn't be acquired for free with that currency would be a possibility. But it's a Market, meaning that demand and stocks fluctuate. Keep that in mind. -A style for everyone: playing Tank, Offensive, Melee, Sniper, etc... Options are numerous, but the best build is the one you prefer. It also comes with the style: Many of the cosmetics may be locked behind premium currency, but taking part of events, trading, or spending a bit of cash (game sometimes offer you a discount, making the purchase worthwhile in my opinion) could unlock you some options to make your warframe truly yours. -Expanding non stop: The game is supported by one of the best dev teams the world has known. devstreams, Player Feedback, Community created content... the game keeps expanding, with every single hotfix making sure the game runs well for everyone; New weapons, quests, events.... From start to Endgame, you will most definitely dicover new things alongside other players. -Media done right: The game has taken many players by surprise with visuals, but also music, story... Cinematic quests made an entry with a shaking story and outstanding reveal in the lore. Art direction is outstanding, and the community takes part in it as well. if you haven't seen the best of the Warframe Fanarts, you are missing out.  There are many things I could talk about, but you're better off giving it a go yourself. You should discover the vast galaxies, blade in hand, by yourself.  If you want a TL:DR, here is one that could sum it up: It's a free game that offers you everything gameplay related for free if you put in the time to grind it. Ever Expanding, always surprising, and never punishing. Come for the gunning, stay for literally (almost) anything it can offer you.",Recommended,2020.04.30,4.0

Warframe,SpaceBallsJim,"Alot of grind, alot of fun, amazing graphics and sounds, great co-op. Quite often host migration can get annoying. Superb open world part of the game. Tons of weapons, warframes, addons, cosmetics, pets, sentinels, quests, side quest storylines... Thumbs up for mastery rank tests, they are gonna get you mad and angry sometimes. But rewarding as you progress to higher ranks. Trading in the game could be improved but its functional to some point. Works, but can be issues. Game works on very old pc and thats a big plus. But if you want to go to open world part of the game you gonna need stronger pc with more ram and better GPU. Game is free so i highly recommend. item mall use is optional. You can get all for free you can buy in the store for real money, but grind is needed. And alot of trading.... You can also mine minerals and gems in game, there is fishing and alot of crafring... and mods (as ingame gameplay mechanics) for every single piece of equipment you can get your hands on...

Warframe,badxben,"Pros:  - Free 2 Play. You can acquire anything in the game without paying a single penny, if you put enough effort into it.  - Fun movement system  - Beautiful graphics  - Fashion is a thing.  - Multiple different playstyles possible.  - I have no personal opinion on PvP as I haven't tried it, but I do know it is modified to be balanced. I know for a fact that Warframes' ability skills are modified.  - Chill community.  - Nice trade system. Can easily acquire premium currency known as platinum. You have to know what you're doing and there's multiple websites that even help you price things you want to sell or even check prices for something you want to buy.  - Clans have enormous member capacity.  Cons(these really aren't cons for me, but they might be for some of you):  - Repetitive in some way.  - Endless grindfest.  - Crafting things can take anywhere between 1 minute to 72 hours. There is no multiple crafting of something, unless you own a blueprint for it that crafts a specific number of the particular item at increased costs obviously. You can rush crafting using premium currency know as Platinum.   My advise to you strangers, try the game. While you're at it, make sure you take advantage of the wonderful community-made websites that I will link below:  - Your epitome of the game. All your questions are hidden deep inside and you must perform extremely difficult finger movements to locate them. Use at your own risk, but do use it 4realdawg.  - Need to sell? Need to buy? Need to trade? Need to check prices? All in here son. I mean the website obviously.  - ""Second Opinion"" or alternate to warframe.market.

Warframe,kaaos,"Warframe is probably the best free-to-play multiplayer game I've experienced. It's not perfect, but the game packs insane amounts of content and depth without obvious paywalls, provides an enjoyable gameplay loop with more than enough variety and boasts one of the more unique and consistent visual styles in the market. While I never quite fell in love with it, Warframe provides a really high quality co-op experience and I'd recommend everyone to atleast check it out.  Technically while Warframe is free, everything ties into the basic loop of grinding missions to level up and gain resources. There's always something to upgrade or strive forwards to, and there's enough genre-defying optional content like fishing and pet-breeding along with single player quests to keep it all interesting for a long time. I personally enjoyed the optional content far more than I probably should've (such as snapping pictures of rare enemy types), but even then I was genuinely impressed of how many interesting designs there are among hundreds of weapons and warframes. The game's a literal timesink, especially as a 4-player co op where you can face actually challenging missions.  As a negative footnote, you can really tell that Warframe is slowly built on top of itself along the way. It still suffers heavily from confusing UI design and ancient progression systems which can really turn off a newcomer without any guidance. I feel like there's a lot that could be done to streamline the experience without sacrificing the depth of the overrall game.",Recommended,2018.03.26,135.9
Warframe,Spodeian,Personally I love this game. It is a grind early on but I think it is very comparable to Payday 2 when it comes to the roots of levelling and getting money but in warframe it takes forever to level up and when you get bored of a weapon instead of resetting the level you just sell it and make a new weapon. Now of course the devs took the opportunity to put in micro transactions but I have no regrets for any money I have spent on this game because I have had so much fun.,Recommended,2014.11.20,586.9
Warframe,Bruudwin,"was notified i have played this game for 2020 hours, i find it appropriate since it is the awful year 2020.  I somewhat recommend the game, just about everything can be earned for free without paying a dime. Takes a longggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg time to do so due to RNG though.  No paywalls of any kind! A lot of things can be bought instead of farming and grinding for them. Whereas some items can unfortunately only be farmed and grinded for. Everyone gets to suffer the time investment to earn those things!  Major updates are about once, thrice a year or so. Only reason to log in every single day is for the log in only rewards (weapons gear etc) on days 100, 250, etc or some numbered days of total log ins.  A mind boggling amount of weapons and customizations for everything. Its why end game is 'fashion frame' not 'warframe' :P  Obviously i received this product for free.",Recommended,2020.07.26,2.0

Warframe,g0re,"Warframe is a third person, cooperative, free2play, action game with a strong sci-fi theme that emphasized fast-paced gunplay as well as melee combat.  What I like: - Very stylish game, nice art style, unique aesthetic and you can do a lot of cool stuff like zipping around the level at high speeds, spinning through the air as a whirling tornado of blades and death and Max-Payne-Style bullet jumps while dual-wielding assault rifles - Large and ever expanding selection of weapons and abilities to use, there is something for everyone here. Want dual swords? Sure. Giant hammer? Of course. Machine guns that slice enemies to pieces? Yup. Shotgun-Axe-Hybrid-Thing? Yeah, game's got that too. - Large potential for optimization and different builds which is certain to please people that like to really get into the numbers game. - Customization options are quite impressive. Even without paying for cosmetics you have a good number of options to make your character look the way you want. You can change the color of just about everything, including your ""hub area"" space ship and a good number of cosmetics can be obtained just by playing the game. - Up until now (which is just over 50h in) the game has kept me motivated very well. It constantly throws new things at you (new weapons to craft and try out, access to more features, different mission types, etc.) even at this point which is nice.   - A good number of systems that make up the meat of the game are barely explained if at all. If you want to get the most out of it, you'll have to read up on it outside the game. - Although the environments are generated somewhat randomly from pre-created tilesets it all blends together after a while and can get a bit samey. I recommend switching between the different planets frequently just to break it up a bit. - As is the nature of the beast, the game relies heavily on grinding for gear and replaying missions. This doesn't really bother me too much but I'm sure some people will be put off by playing the same mission 10 times in a row just to get the something they already have in abundance instead of the one piece they need.   - While the game can be played solo for the most part it is definitely more enjoyable with a group, especially starting mid-game when the difficulty begins to ramp up. - I personally think the free2play model is well executed and fair, keeping most purchases completely optional. Many items in the item shop are priced quite highly though which - at least in my opinion - makes them not worth the money. I'd rather spend more time playing the game I enjoy then spending a lot of money on a shortcut. That said, there are a number of reasonably priced items in the shop that can enhance your game experience quite a bit. How you want to deal with that is of course up to you. It is entirely possible to get premium currency by selling rare items to other players for example so you don't have to spend actually money if you don't want to.   I enjoy Warframe quite a bit and will surely continue to play more of it. Can't beat stylish space ninjas with lightning guns and fire swords.   So turns out I did play more of it, quite a lot more in fact. The review above was written about a year ago and I still play the game almost every day. At the time of this writing, the Plains of Eidolon update is the most recent patch and I have to say it made me take a break from the game because the new open-wordly area lacks pretty much everything that actually makes the game itself great and adds a lot of unnecessary garbage that departs heavily from the ""kill stuff as awesome as possible"" formula. I sincerly hope that DE takes the criticism about that kind of content to heart and cosiders the future path of the game carefully because if they turn the whole game into Plains-style, large map, rep grinding fests it will lose some of it's space ninja magic!   So another major open world content update has just dropped in Fortuna. It seems that DE has decided that that is how the game is going to evolve from this point forward, which I personally find sad. Fortuna and the Orb Vallis (the surronding area) are about 200 times better than what the Plains of Eidolon turned out to be in my opinion, which is good. I am still very much not a fan of focussing on open world content but they have improved the way they approach it a bit. The area itself is a lot more interesting (not just a brown and grey mess) and the mission types are less annoying (though not by much). However, they once again added more and more stuff to the game that barely integrates with the rest. The community seems to love the new hoverboards but all I can think of is... does anybody else still remember when this game was about ninjas?!  That being said: it is still a great game and comes highly recommended to everybody that enjoys ninjas, fun weapons and making crazy builds to murder fools with!",Recommended,2016.02.21,1.0

I didn't have steam back then, so I downloaded it directly from the site. It had one of the best and friendliest communities. You meet amazing people as you play, as I have over the years that I have played this game. Of course, there will always be rotten apples, but that's anywhere.  The game is all about grind. You gotta work for all the materials, for the platinum (which can be used to buy anything else on the market in-game), for credits (which you need when you want to build something or trade), and resources that are needed to make your weapons, warframes, etc; and this will take some times (maybe even hours). But when you're with a great team, and chatting it up, time flies.  The graphics are great, and sometimes you may even bump into some of the devs in game :P  But overall, I think it's a game that may be fun and amazing for some people, but a game that may not be someone else's cup of tea.

Unless you have a friend who's a veteran, you're gonna have trouble getting use to the mechanics, weapons, enemies, and levels.  However, once you ARE used to the game, you'll realize that it's worth the effort. There are a lot of things (missions, raids, sorties, petting animals, maybe conclave if you're into that) to do in the game.  If you do get to this point, I recommend having fun with the game instead of trying to be the most powerful player.",Recommended,2014.01.25,972.6
Warframe,ZomB Chkn,"Warframe is a cooperative Third Person Shooter which involves a strange blend of melee combat, shooting, and parkour. There, now that we've gotten the standards out of the way, Warframe is a good game, good meaning that it has its pros and it's cons. When it comes to pros, the graphics quality is amazing for a Free-To-Play game, everything stays moderately difficult (and even harder if you play like you're supposed to, you know, 2 or 3 friends all starting at the same time), and the parkour system is very smooth and easy to use, even for new TPS players. Since the last time I reviewed this game, it has changed greatly. Whereas before I was too scared to make a new weapon due to credit and resource restrictions, I've found that resources are much more common in most cases, so I've been free to experiment with guns and find the ones I like. (Latron I love ya baby.) Now I have a set of cleavers, two hammers, a machine gun, rifle, shotgun, several swords, and the list goes on. The best part about this, though, is that, since credits are more easily achievable now, I've been able to experiment without fear of losing much. Also, the way you earn warframes has also changed much. Whereas before, there was a chance that it may or may not spawn once every 5th moon after you've sacrificed your firstborn, now you're guaranteed to get a frame part after fighting the boss that drops them, so I've actually coughed up some plat and now have six warframes, all of which provide an incredible spin on gameplay, forcing you to change your playstyle for each frame. Of course, I've got a favorite, (Nyx I love ya baby.) but each frame is a refreshing take on the game that renews it completely. To continue, the levels are now actually changed. The levels change style depending on who's in control of the planet. Of course, if you play the same planet alot, then you may begin to notice that the levels are the same, but that can be expected of any game. However, it can still be a tad grindy at times, and several of my friends found the beginning of the game too hard a hurdle for them and quit early on due to the upper levels carrying them through the low levels and making the game boring for them, so if you're going to enjoy this game, it's a NECESSITY that you don't play public matchmaking. Players tend to rush through the levels and not allow the lowers to really enjoy the game or even get a kill, for that matter. If you're going to play, you either need to play by yourself or with friends.  I Recommend this game, (Provided you've got some friends to play this with.)

Warframe,RiptoR,"There isn't much handholding so you'll need to figure out how everything works, but you'll have a blast doing just that (it helps that the community is extremely helpful and friendly). And once you find your flow, the game will suck you in hard, so be prepared. I hadn't played since the closed beta, and only reinstalled it 3 months ago (109 days to be exact), but since then i've clocked over 550 hours in the game.  There so much to do and figure out, that it's hard to believe this game is actually free-2-play. Rest assured though, it certainly isn't pay-2-win. Warframe has one of the best monetisation schemes I've come across in F2P games. You can earn everything by simply playing the game (except for a large part of the cosmetic items), and you'll never feel like you need to spend real cash to progress in the game. I wouldn't be surprised if you end up buying a bit of platinum (the ingame premium currency) just to support the developers. I certainly did so.  So to conclude: If you don't mind the grind, you'll find this game will scratch an itch you never knew you had.  Highly recommended.",Recommended,2017.11.23,1.0

Warframe,bass,"Alright, this game may be somewhat pay-to-win; but, it is very easy to earn your way up the community and be LEAGUES better than those who have paid for platinum.  I give this game 5 out of 5 for the hard work put into it (though I experienced a glitch just last night, which was fine since it only lasted a couple seconds), and the voice acting is beyond what you'd expect.  Graphics quality is great for the type of game you're given and you can tell from a consumer's point of view that the models are very polished.  The game play is very nice, freeflowing ninja-esque fun! Stealth is achievable, but you can always go with the option of guns-blazing.  Overall the game is a great piece of technology at its finest, the community is always willing to help new players since its a challenge to even get good a the game and call yourself ""an expert Tenno"". If you're having thoughts of downloading this game, you really should, after all - it's free.  Addendum, 466 more hours in and the first sentence is already terrible.

Really immersive gameplay with a wide variety of warframes to play as and unique play styles.  It's really hard to describe or fully put into words.  Honestly? I hope they add more open-worlds on different planets, how cool that would be to be on a waterplanet (Uranus) or other planets like Mercury and Saturn including the Moon or even an open world Void.  Idk just tossing these ideas out there but would be amazing to see them honestly.  Cons: Repetitive, honestly it's hard to fully enjoy it when you do the same thing over and over, it's more like a grind and farm.  {I had a previous review, yes I could've edited it, but I wanted a fresh review}  Plains of Eidolon has renewed my want to play this game!",Recommended,2016.05.15,1.0

Warframe,ivlr3vil,"Highly recommend it, definitely the best free to play game I've played so far. It's hard to imagine them not charging people for this game. The co-op play is a bit lackluster compared to the single player experience though because the quality of gameplay depends on which user is hosting. So if the user has a very slow upload speed, you could be thrown out of the game or fail the mission because of that. Game levels go by very quickly in co-op, but for a very scary and intense immersive experience, I highly recommend just changing the game mode to single player.",Recommended,2014.04.14,2.0
Warframe,Noodle,"This game is absolutely hands down the best free to play game there is on the market right now. The best way I can describe the actual gameplay of this game is a Sci-Fi Third Person Shooter RPG Gauntlet Legends. It has RPG character building elements with an Arcade feel, really making it feel like you can jump in or leave at any time you want to. What's refreshing about this game though is that character levels don't necessarily mean that you can't play with your friends if say you're overleveled or if they are just getting started, and this also applies to missions. Anybody can join any of their friends, wherever the are, and at whatever level. This ultimately makes for a desirable gaming experience unique to RPG games.  Now I know what you're thinking, ""Every free to play game is pay to win."" Nope. Spending money in this game doesn't give any gameplay benefit over those who don't. However, if you want to have slots for more than 2 characters and a couple of weapons, you will eventually have to pay money. So it's not really ""Pay to win"", per say, it's more ""Pay to have access to more things and get things sooner.""  But most importantly, the game doesn't feel incomplete despite it being a free to play game, which means that eventually paying money for it doesn't feel like you're spending it on a free to play game. I personally found that I was just unlocking the full game by paying for it.  As an added bonus, the game dev's like what they are doing, and they all happen to be gamers themselves.",Recommended,2014.02.12,164.5

It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn it's simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist.

Pros: - Free to play; - Very decent graphics with good port (works fine 55~70fps on a not-so-good laptop); - Increasing content; - Interesting world and story (in development); - Easy to learn, fun mechanics; - Decent, helpful community (at review date); - Warframe wiki available with pretty much everything you need to know and even things you don't need to know (check cons).  Cons: - Grinding is a must for absolutely everything (RNG-based item rewards); - Game is still (and probably for a long time) in development. Lots of random glitches and bugs - which are quickly fixed as developers carefully watch the forum reports, but there's always something -, and it takes time to progress in the story; - Reading the wiki is absolutely necessary to fully understand the mechanics as the game doesn't really explain you anything to a formula level; - Endgame is FashionFrame (it gets boring once you've reached all the game has to offer and the best you can do is make your warframes look cool, but it's always worth coming back as more content comes).

Warframe,General Pacman,"First of all, let me start by saying that this game is definitely not for everyone. The grinding is huge, and it will take a lot of your play time. Also, the game is currently not very friendly to newcomers; you will login for the first time, play the first 2-3 missions, and then you will find yourself walking around, having no clue on how to progress. My advice? if you have the chance, try to start playing with someone who already has a little experience in the game. Otherwise, get ready to start asking a lot of questions on chat, or to keep the wiki open almost all the time.  Having said that, lets move to the actual review.  After playing Warframe for nearly 6 years (with some breaks in the middle), I still cannot find a game with better combat mechanics. The fighting system is just amazing, there is no better word to describe it. You can do all sorts of crazy parkour movements while shooting down your enemies; and trust me, every single kill feels incredibly satisfying.  Do you want to jump and propel yourself like a spear to shoot a dude in the face at point-blank range? You can do it. Do you want to to turn your enemies into pincushions by throwing dozens of kunais at them while wall running? Go for it. Do you want to jump from a three-store building to land on top of someone´s head with your giant steel hammer? Be my guest. Do you just want to stay still and watch your giant mutant alien pet rip and eat your enemies alive? Dude, you are a bit creepy... but feel free to do it.  Speaking of weapons, Warframe currently has a ridiculous amount of weapons to choose. From something as simple as a staff, to katanas, daggers, war axes, longswords, hammers, spears, bows, crossbows, rifles, machine guns, SMGs, shotguns, grenade launchers, flame throwers, railguns, energy guns... and i could go on. The amount of weaponry available allows you to customize your playstyle as much as you want.  And then you have the warframes. Apart from the weapons, you will have to obtain, craft and level up different ""suits"" called warframes, each one of them with their unique set of stats, skills and abilities. You will find support ones, tanks, dps, crowd controllers, hybrids, etc. There are currently over 32 unique warframes in the game, plus the Prime warframes, which are enhanced, more powerful versions of some of them.  The game visuals are incredible, for a game released on 2013. Its very well optimized, so you can run it on any potato with medium-low settings.  As most free-to-play games, Warframe has a microtransactions market, where you can pay to get most of the items described above, as well as vanity items, such as skins (both for warframes and weapons), capes, colour palettes, and some other stuff. The thing is, the currency required to buy this things (platinum) is tradeable, which means you can get almost every possible item in the game without spending a cent (except for the tennogen items, wich are made by the community and are bought via steam). In my case, i spent some money for the first time a couple of weeks ago, having obtained most of the stuff i wanted waaay before that.  And least but not less, the community. Warframe has one of the best (if not THE best) player base i´ve seen in all my years of gaming. Yes, you may find some toxic players here and there, but the core and vast majority of the community is highly friendly and helpful.  Regarding the cons of this game, the only two flaws i can think of (besides the ones described at the beginning), are PvP and the Archwing system. PvP in warframe is not really popular, there isnt a high amount of players actively playing it; and the rewards you can get from it are mostly to be used only in PvP. Regarding the Archwings, im not even going to get into details; they just suck, and they should never have been added to the game. If you get to the point where you can start using them, you will know what i mean.  In conclussion, i highly recommend this game. As i said at the beginning, its not for everyone; but if you can handle the heavy grind, you will find a game that will entertain you for quite a long time.   One last thing: you may have noticed some negative (and i mean, really negative) reviews written by people who have insane amounts of playtime, some of them with more than 2k hours. This is something that i never saw in any other game, at least not at the amount you can find here. Don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and i respect that; but man, if a free game gave you so many hours of entertainment, heck, it cant be THAT bad, right?  I apologize in advance for my terrible spelling; as you may have noticed, english is not my main language. I hope this review was useful to you in any way.

Warframe,Miss Mono,"Warframe is a fast paced F2P game that rewards long time players over buying in-game items. Warframe may seem hard at first to play but the game only gets more easy the longer you stick with it even offering some of the best in-game weapons for free during events (that are more often than you think) and special dates like christmas,easter etc. Warframe has a massive amount of content to explore including frames,weapons and even pets. The way to aquire these items is through collecting materials throughout the solar system and at first glance it would give the impression of too much grinding but it encurages you to explore and seek out new planets and rewards. Warframe does have a paid for currency that allows you to buy nearly anything in the game BUT, what warframe has that others games dont is that you can trade for that currency with rewards you have earned by playing the game. Warframe does have problems though with some of the best content being far to hard to get even for long time players and, balancing on weapons and frames is a very rocky path with some of the best content being reduced to mastery fodder. Overall warframe is not for everyone but is lots of fun to play and is updated every wensday with new content and provides lots of enterainment, its a must play F2P game.",Recommended,2014.09.23,9.0

Warframe,Burning Knuckle,"So it's uhhh, been a few years huh? According to steam I have over 3k hours into the game but I stopped playing around the scarelt spear event. I stopped playing cause I felt burnt out by the game and that it wasn't really respecting my time with it. Remember this was a while ago where DE will nerf things that are the most used (they probably still do that huh) and they're way of making enemies difficult would make them bullet sponges. So why am I still recommending this even though I had a pretty bad experience in the past? It's because I want to give this game the benefit of the doubt and that it probably has improved over time. I want to be proven wrong on the statements that I have made that it doesn't respect your time. This game is really grindy and having meaningful rewards is close to none. I will like to state this again, my experience was a while ago and it's pretty unfair for me to not recommend this game when I haven't really followed the updates and haven't really and what happened in the past can't reflect of it's today's product. Then why make a review of the game? Cause I really care about this game and it's development, but over time I've seen it losing players because of certain decisions, but now I'm seeing it getting players and more positive reviews, I just don't know if I want to go through the whole process again and be disappointed.",Recommended,2017.09.02,3.0

Warframe,herrdoktor330,"Warframe kind of reminds me of PvE Global Agenda in respect to that it's a squad based Co-op shooter. I really liked Global Agenda, so I have a like for this too. The F2P model in this isn't bad, although they really stick it to you in buying better weapons (the starter weapons are kind of weak and it's a tough time to get the material to craft better ones if you don't have a good squad to take you through the latter half of the missions). The customization is pretty deep with the ""mod system"", which is kind of like ""trading card"" modifiers that apply to your weapons and armor. My only complaints is that the ""free run"" mechanic feels a little hit or miss (although I may just suck at it right now) and I wish the in-game chat text was bigger. I feel like the text pretty easy to miss when you're frantically running around. Although there may be a setting I'm not seeing to adjust it. All in all, fun time for free.

Warframe,Reguleo,"Warframe is what people would think is your standred Sci-fi MMORPG, it has space ninja, Space Magic and Many different weapons that you have to grind for. this would usally send people away. i urgue that those who have not played the game to give it a shot. Instead of boring you with a wall of text here is a list of What is good and bad about this game:  Pros: - The Fun Grind, yes i said it, FUN grind - The Diversity and unquieness of each Warframe - The crafting System - The Easy to learn Parkour - Modding Weapons and Warframes to make them more powerfull - No Pay to Win - Compalling Storyline - The Dev team is open minded, will be quick to listen and is supportive to the player base. their kind of the mates you never realised arn't your mates - It keeps growing - (Mostly)Supportive Community - Premium Currency is not hidden by a paywall, it can be gotten by getting rare or hard to get parts and selling them in the trade chat  Cons: - Long crafting time and i mean like 3 days to craft some stuff (There is stuff to do daily though) - RNG focus, build a shrine and pray cause RNG is ruthless (Use the recruitment chat to get a squad) - Steep Learning curve (Use the recruitment chat to find help or a guide of the lotus) - Good luck with the workshop (Its takes a while for DE to process it) - Plat is Key, you need to trade like mad (get advice and check the Warframe market for a good price which is not rediculous) - Some times things are Daunting (But do a little research and things become easier) - Getting into a GOOD clan is hard and remaining is even harder - Sometimes it just eats up alot of time if you are busy - Heavy relience on premium currency (Which can be gotten without money as said before) - Really distracting cause its too damn fun (does this even go here?)  Anyway i urge anyone who is on the fence or even refusing to play the game to at least get a group of friends together and try this game, cause it a alot of fun and even though the grind can get to you, when its over you would feel rewarded for your efforts, leaving a sence of completion. Also don't trust the metacritic review, its extremely outdated cause warframe is a growing game, so alot of the problems they had are fixed.",Recommended,2017.11.04,1.0

The graphics are unbelievable, the gameplay is fun, the characters are diverse and interesting, and the quests are amazing. Second Dream, Octavia's Anthem and The War Within are among my favorites because of its emotional appeal to the player. One sign of great storytelling is getting your audience to be emotionally invested in what you're writing, and that's exactly what DE's writers did to this particular player.  The game isn't perfect because of a few mechanics that needs improvement, but it's surely superb. The devs are also very responsive to the playerbase. Warframe definitely is a labor of love.

Warframe,Dogbowl,"Warframe is amazingly addicting. New content releases such as new and prime warframes and new missions are quite frequent, and end up keeping up interest when the game starts to get stale. The amount of cosmetic options is absolutely enormous. Certain weapons and warframes are extremely satisfying to use.  On the flip side, Warframe can end up feeling like too much of a grind sometimes. You have to play missions over and over to get parts to build warframes and weapons because the parts you get are determined by chance. You could always buy the parts, and although the game itself is free, you would have to spend money on plat to trade with other players.  Now, that may sound pretty bad to some, but in my opinion, the fun you can have using the warframes and weapons you get mitigates some of the annoyance of the grind.",Recommended,2016.11.27,1.0

Warframe,V,"Realistically, it's a really repetitive game, with you requiring to obtain a variety of resources to build something, only to collect more resources to build something else, from a variety of missions that can seem never-ending at times. However, some things (personal favorites) are really fun to do, and having a team of friends help you with missions really aids the whole experience for this game.  It's really nice that there's a regular release of in-game events to carry on the ever-going storyline and EVEN MORE weapons that....might not be used after you're done using it for a quest and leveling it up to the max. Not all the new stuff gets a standing ovation though.....

Asides from the system and mechanics, it has a range of very well designed warframes where each one of them is created with a particular theme, whether an element or another type of power. But the most important aspect are the operators, which are essentialy the users themselves, they have very good customization options and also match very well in combination with their warframes, there are also various factions, syndicates and other types of interactions which attach together very well within the overall narrative.",Recommended,2015.04.21,480.3

Warframe,SuperJew,"Have you ever wanted a retro ninga game? Well, this is for you. This 4 player player third-person shooter is good for freinds looking for a good time. You play as a Tenno, an advanced race of beings, who have these advanced suits called Warframes each with their own special characteristics and abilitys. You, and 3 other players, go from planet to planet, to help and save it, from the deep jungles of Earth, to the icy and cold wastelands of Mars. Every planet has a boss that you must defeat to advance to the next planet, and getting there is half the fun. The controls of this game are very fluint and wallrunning and sliding around the map makes you feel like a badass ninja. The weapons in this game all have their own feel to them, and exploring and testing out which ones are good for you can be very fun. Plus, all the mods you can put on them make it feel like your own. The imagery and art style of this game is amazing, and beutifal to look at. I found myself stopping and looking around at the beutifal scenary and architexture before speeding off again to join the rest of my teamates. The time when you are surrounded by hundreds of enemies, and you pull off your special move to clear them all away is something to admire. The best thing about this game is that it's free, so play to your hearts content. Be prepared to grind a lot though, if you want to be able to get all of the other cool and amazing weapons, and Warframes without spending any money, it's going to take many hours. This game is a very strong money pusher, but if you stay head strong and just grind, you will get to where you don't need to spend a dime on what you want. My other gripe about this game is that the crafting system and market isn't really explained well, and can be confusing to first timers. But, once you are able to learn and play, you will be sucked in this game for hours on end, and you won't want to stop. from a scale of 1 to 10, i would give this game a 8 out of 10. Hope this helped!",Recommended,2014.03.19,514.3

Warframe,Xenny,"TLDR: Pay2BePretty, not Pay2Win. Give it a 30 hours try, do the quests, and decide for yourself.  I followed this game since it came out of ""Beta"" and I only started playing ""for real"" last year. The devs work hard to improve it every week.  Warframe had some uncertain beginnings, but it is now one of the only games I play. Incredible timesink (if you allow it to be), but very fun. A lot to do, the game is visually appealing and the community can be very good if you find the right circle for you.  Warning: The first 8 quest of the ""Story"" (as of 2017-2018) are quite ""boring"" for some, as they were made before the ""Cinematic"" quests were introduced. If you survive until the 9th quest, things get a LOT more interesting and is very much worth the wait.  Concerning the ""pay to win"" illusion; no, you do NOT need to spend any real world money on this game. Not even to acquire the ""premium"" currency (called Platinum). You can trade some of your excess loot in exchange for platinum.  Platinum is mostly used to speed up your progression, or for cosmetics.  One of the few things you can only obtain through real-world currency are the accessories that come with every ""Prime Access"" (which is the way the company introduces the new characters - ""Warframes"". The new characters and their signature weapons can be obtained for free, but the cosmetic accessories cannot. Those are exclusive to players who purchase the bundle.  Simply remember that buying Platinum or Prime Access with real money puts real money in the pockets of the devs, which aren't funded by a big studio like Ubisoft or others. Everything comes from their wallets, and ours.  There's also ""Tennogen"", which is Warframe's way to hand-pick workshop content and put it into the game. That money goes in the content creator's pockets.",Recommended,2018.04.29,2.0

Warframe,Pelly,"With Warframe being one of my most played games in my Libary, I think it qualifies as one of the most enticing games I have ever played. The constant updates, both major and minor add content or change content (usually for the better, though the nerf to the Tonkor still hurts to this day). Visually the game can be quite beatiful, even stunning at times. Audio-wise the music can vary from un-obtusive to bombastic with all being very nice to listen to. Game-feel, is very pleasant with moment to moment combat, movement and just action being extremely satisfying. The actual gameplay is repetitive but does have large amounts satisfaction from the visual and audio feedback for flying through enemies. Honestly, there is too much that I like about Warframe that I cannot really quantify it.

It gives you that hardcore mmo grind vibe in bite sized portions, that you can dip in and play for 10-30 minutes and still be able to break off and leave if you need to. They constantly keep adding new content which is great to see in any mmo. I was stand offish about this game a long time and regret not playing it sooner now. If you are on the fence about this game give it a try.  Update: It's 2019 and I still play this game. They keep adding quality content for free. The graphics still look great. The movement mechanics still feel great. A cohesive storyline is now fleshed out. There simply is no other game on the market that gives me the same feeling as this game.

Sometimes they seem to blend together into an indistnguishable mess of 1 really powerful enemy surrounded by identical enemies made of paper.  Mobility of the game is extremely fun though and boss fights really feel good to play. PVP can be fun sometimes if your opponent is honorable. It has Pay to Play elements that feel very fair but it is grindy non-the less. The characters you can choose from at the start are pretty powerful. The game looks really nice, its lore is fairly interesting. The music is nice and some of the characters have great personality.   Overall, not a bad game.",Recommended,2017.08.29,47.6

A lot of grinding involved however, which I guess is the only downside in my opinion, but I have to say that for a FREE TO PLAY game it is fun to grind with other players and friends, most of the time it's not tediously repetitive at all.

Warframe,yumiko❤ᴋᴀꜱᴜᴛᴇʀᴀ,"Warframe is a prime example of how free-to-play games can be both financially sustainable and enjoyable. The in-game economy is fair, and the majority of items can be earned through gameplay, reducing the pay-to-win factor. The level of customization available for Warframes, weapons, and other gear is staggering. This allows players to fine-tune their playstyle and appearance, adding a personal touch to the gaming experience. Warframe has a dedicated and passionate player base. The community is known for its friendliness and willingness to help new players, creating a positive and welcoming environment. The game's complexity can be overwhelming for newcomers. While there are tutorials, it takes time to fully grasp the intricacies of Warframe's mechanics, which may deter some players. Some missions can become repetitive, especially when grinding for specific resources or items. While the constant addition of new content helps alleviate this, it's a challenge that the game still faces. Warframe's addictiveness stems from its perfect balance of action, exploration, and progression. The constant sense of achievement, whether through acquiring a new Warframe, mastering a difficult mission, or discovering a hidden lore detail, keeps players hooked. The game's live-service model ensures that there's always something to look forward to, making it difficult to put down. Additionally, the cooperative nature of the gameplay fosters a sense of community and shared accomplishments, further enhancing the addictive nature of Warframe.  In conclusion, Warframe is a stellar example of a free-to-play game that not only delivers on its promises but continually surpasses expectations.

Warframe,KAT,"Truely an above AAA quality game hidden in a F2P package.  Warframe is downright, amazing. You may be thinking to yourself but its F2P so its prob got some P2W or really hard grind in it, well it doesn't.  Warframe being a PVE focussed and actually allowing its premium currency to be used as a trading item makes you able as a F2P player to easily without any effort (okay you gotta be a little dedicated to playing the game) to get basically anything in the game!  The loving devs and friendly community and even better an endless expanding world with every new update make this game thrive and grow unlike any game I've played before it!  Not to mention the massive hidden story it has (don't Google it, experience it yourself) Quests like Second Dream and The war within litterly made me just not believe this game was free.  But it is free, and for us all to enjoy.  So Tenno, Grab your watchamacallit, tell Ordis to shut his face and get ready to save the Solar system!",Recommended,2018.11.23,252.4
Warframe,Stardancer,"I love this game. There is a quite a bit of grinding involved and a little bit of a learning curve (which coming from normal ability bar mmo area took some practice to get used to), but the game is full of content and more is added often, loaded with beautiful graphics, has a wonderful soundtrack and free to play!  Virtually everything can be done or crafted without having to buy in-game currency. Many weapons can be researched in your clan's dojo and all warframes (besides those currently in the prime vault) can be farmed for as mission rewards, from enemy drops, or caches. You can solo or pug, but the game is best played with a group of friends.  At over 1,000 hours play, I can say that I still love this game!

Follow new adventures or trace fragments of the past with filled wonder and woe. Willing to go through hell and back to obtain absolutely anything. Especially. The. Spaceship.  All to become the fanciest, danciest, techno-organic powerhouse of slaying in the cosmos. ...And maybe help save the solar system.  Should anything actually go wrong, just tell the devs in the appropriate forum. I should elaborate on this, the game for the most part runs very well and improves wih each update but ocassionally (maybe more for some) significant bugs appear, most notably during large updates introducing new features or systems like Plains of Eidolon. Though they are detrimental, the devs have risen to correcting these time after time which is great. Only a handful of issues surface over and over and are typically mulled over till the devs and players are satisfied.  I really should slap my past self for not buying a founders pack.

This game can be played alone but it is much better with friends. Warframe does have a premium currency called Platnium, but it is not unobtainable without purchace. You can find certain crafting parts in the game to sell to other players for this currency. Warframe does start out a bit slow, but it gets better as you get later into the game. The developers are very active and always making sure that they can fix any bugs or glitches.",Recommended,2014.12.07,344.0
Warframe,⼁Ŝøϭи∆⼁,"I can't do nothing but recommend this game. I've read several comments saying that most of the game's systems are not explained. And yeah, you got a little introduction and then u're free to investigate it all by your own, just playing. You can also check the wiki tho. There, you can find even the damage formulas so... I think it's a good thing that we're not treated like babies who can't understand nothing. I must say, as well, the first few hours are a bit confusing, but if u want to understand the game, you will, just gotta think a bit (more than I can expect from some people, apparently). That's the only objectively bad point about this game. Everything else is just a matter of taste. This game is based in a power fantasy, you're playing as the most powerful battle machine ever existed, so don't come here wanting a challenge like it was a Souls Like. You will face some challenges. It'll get rough the first time u see an Eidolon, for example. But if u're properly prepared for what you're gonna do, it won't be hard. The game is completely free to play since you can get the premium currency just by playing the game (still have to pay for some of the cosmetics). The only advantage you get by paying microtransactions is getting from point A to point B in your progression a little faster. The community is only comparable with minecraft's. Graphics, gameplay and customization are just on point. If you have free time to dedicate to a game but none get to catch you: Try Warframe.",Recommended,2022.04.22,4.0

However i'd recommend most people to play up until finishing the quests and leaving it at that (unless they add raids back, which was the most enjoyable aspect for me before they removed them ""temporarily"") attempting to go beyond that contains a ton of grinding i wouldn't recommend most people to do.",Recommended,2021.03.09,5.0

Warframe,Pastakauha,"Warframe has its problems with updates bringing a bunch of negatives with the positive additions and fixes. Grinding and farming for gear is a major part of the game. The Wiki is pretty much a required tool, unless you have friends to tell you about mechanics and whatnot.  BUT! If we are having fun while ""working"" to get our hands on different ways to annihilate hordes of enemies, I don't mind the grind and having some mystery behind game mechanics keeps things interesting. Enjoyable gameplay is probably the top thing I look for in games. Warframe got that right in my opinion. Gunplay feels good and has plenty of variety. Movement through environments has some skill involved and feels rewarding as you get better at parkouring through massive spaceships and hostile celestial bodies. Customization is complex enough to try out different ideas, but simple enough to not turn you away if you don't have time to theorycraft.  Warframe's free to play model is fair and falls into the progress-faster-category. Platinum, the premium currency, is not too hard to get just by playing and trading ""Primed"" loot with players. Platinum is used for trading, cosmetic items and of course some ""shortcuts"" to get stuff. Overall, it is NOT Pay-to-win.  The community is very good, compared to usual cesspools caused by internet anonymity. New players can feel welcomed and there's always someone looking to help you figure things out. Digital Extremes, the company behind Warframe, is rather well connected to players and they do listen to feedback.  For 9 months now has Warframe had me hooked, playing nearly every day. It's not for everyone nor perfect, but certainly deserves a try.",Recommended,2016.11.27,2.0

It's smoother and much more optimised (although me getting an upgraded PC helped) and there is SO much more content than before. It's still basically the same old grindfest (and it's still almost impossible to find pick-up groups for normal mission progression) but with so many new mission types, areas, enemies, factions, the Archwing (which reminds me SO much of Zone of the Enders) there's actually a hell of a lot to do.

Warframe,Festive Winter,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

Warframe,Nerdy Rodent,"Didn't realise this was still an open beta, not a final release! Having been burnt by purchases in ""open beta"" before, I saw a big ""buyer beware - purchase ye not anything until release"" sign. (Purchases in this case, are in the form of ""Platinum"").  Warframe, however, seems to class itself as ""beta"" purely because they're continually updating and adapting the game. This is GREAT. Like, for example, just adding flying quests in! Purchases are not Pay2Win - they are optional. This is the only ""free 2 play"" model that I will make purchases in, and have done with Warframe, purely for fun! I bought a nice flowing scarf and some extra warframe slots.  The game starts well, and Lotus has a good voice actor - you'll hear a lot of her! The initial tutorial has intuitive controls, and afterwards you are presented with a great sci-fi looking interface. It is basically a shooter - aim crosshair at the head and fire. Don't get pwnd. You can also melee things and each warframe has 4 special powers, just to mix things up. There are loads of game types, such as extermination and survival (these change sometimes too, with new things being added).  As for the graphics engine - it couldn't automatically detect the correct graphical settings, and started in a low resolution. Upon manually setting the correct resolution and putting everything on max, the game ran as smooth as melted butter. And boy do the graphics look good! They have a great style!  Right after the tutorial, you get thrown into what appears to be another single-player tutorial mission, but is in fact a multi-player one. You will have no idea what is going on, no time to look around. Its a straight dash to the end simply following the others - if you can. It is very easy to get lost, especially if the others have ducked through a grate. The game continues like this until you get an understanding of what is going on (which took me around 30 minutes).  You get 4 lives per day for each warframe you own. Use your lives, lose your play for the day. This has never yet happened to me though :)  Overall, very enjoyable.

Warframe,Keonyn ♣,"After all the hours I've put in to this game I'd say it certainly deserves a word or two.  Warframe is a rare gem in the sea of crap that is the F2P market. The game has a lot of polish and a very dedicated developer that is constantly dishing out content. Just this past year they've released two large open-world zones that were huge game-altering changes. The games main story arc is also pretty epic and easily compares to most major titles all while allowing you to enjoy it with your friends.  The best part is that the game isn't P2W. It certainly provides bang for your buck if you decide to go the cash route, but you are still able to enjoy the game even if you don't pay a cent. The grind can be pretty substantial for some things in the game so going the pay route is largely done if you just want to rush content. The other primary pay element would be cosmetics only. An interesting element of the cosmetics though is that some items (Tennogen) are user created and part of the earnings for those sales goes to those users.  All-in-all I see Warframe as a rare example of a F2P done right and their longevity in the market and how active the devs still are is a testament to the support companies can receive if they just do it properly.",Recommended,2018.11.27,2.0
Warframe,Polar7000,"Here are the good things about this game when you play Warframe.  1. You can become an ninja. In the game, you can literally be a ninja that can do sorts of things like fly in space which is known as an Archwing if you haven't known yet.  2. You can literally parkour. Just like Assassin's Creed, Warframe has recently added a new parkour system that can allow you to parkour through walls but not as that intense as Assassin's Creed.  3. You can have companions. - Seriously what kind of ninjas own pets. It's so cool that companions even have their own weapons and you can mod them to make them as powerful as your character or warframe. The only bad thing is that if you own a Kubrow they don't have weapons. Too sad for Kubrow owners. R.I.P.  4. The most awesome thing you can have is a freaking katana. The katana is called the Dragon Nikana and it's the ultimate weapon for a true ninja. The bad thing is you have to be at least Mastery Rank 8 to unlock it, get the blueprint, and use it.

Warframe,Eryth,"Just as a heads up for people who are thinking about trying it out, the game doesn't really require skill in the same way that MOBAs or FPS do. Reaction time along with quick and flashy plays aren't going to make you good. It's all about builds and number-crunching. Also, the game has a LOT of grinding. If you're one of those people with serious time-constraints because of jobs and whatever else you have to deal with in your life, you can play the game, just don't expect to make huge amounts of progress.  Rest of review removed, as it's very outdated by now. Play if you want and when you want; the game isn't going to gate you from something just because you weren't there the second the game told you to be there.",Recommended,2018.05.27,4.0
Warframe,Lenny B.,"I have spent (unbeknownst to me) over 300 hours playing this game and I have nothing but positive things to say. Despite the fact that many free-to-play games often require you to pay in order to progress, this isn't true with Warframe. As I've learned from the very beginning you could play for hours-upon-hours without having to spend a single penny. It wasn't until I was nearing 100 hours that I realized how much I enjoyed this game. Not only that, but I also thought that investing in (platinum for) the game would only help make my already-pleasant experience even better.  Warframe has evolved alot in the small amount of time that I've played it. Through player purchases the developers have added new maps, new mods, a killer melee battling system, and outstanding and unique missions and modes that only add to the spontaneity of this game. Just imagine a game that mixes Ninja Gaiden with Call of Duty with Vanquish. From my own personal experience, it's worth checking out - especially if you're a college student (like myself) and are strapped for spending money on the new games coming out every-so-often.  Give this game a shot and I'm sure you will come to find at least a few things that make Warframe a fun, great, and unique experience.  Game On.  - Lenny",Recommended,2014.06.04,391.0

The Plains are massive and have so much stuff and things to do it blows my mind. The only issue is the bugs, but given that the update literally just came out yesterday, I'll forgive that. This update is so amazing and large, my entire squad spent over an hour ignoring a mission to go fishing. And we were screamin, laughing and crying our asses off doing that.  If you haven't already picked this game up, GET IT NOW",Recommended,2017.10.13,2.0
Warframe,MechaTails,"Product received for free  Warframe is one of the most socially destructive games out there, in league with Maple Story, Satan, and whatever that shooting game is with the sapphic erotica chicks who wear bird armor and talk in a goofy British accent.  I have about 70,000 hours in this game and would do almost anything to get them back. If you're still in school, DO NOT play this game. Listen, don't throw your life away. Don't neglect your friends and your school work and your ambitions just because you need to wait all day to grind for Grindium to build a Grinding Grounder to grind grunts into skate cakes. Go outside. Chase girls, join the military, learn to build a house, hang out with your family, ride a bike across the country, anything, just get out there and don't touch this game because it will ruin you.  This is a great game. It's a mindless horde-shooter at heart, with a massive, crazy sci-fi armory thrown in. You start as a humble space ninja, awakened from an eternal nap by your thick, cyber-dreaded space momma who spends the rest of the game teaching you how to achieve Balance through galactic genocide. Do your best to navigate the abyss known as Trade Chat and survive the eternal grind.  Then, much later, when you're a seasoned, jaded old Tenno, who can't even find joy in soaring through the Rings of Saturn with your sweet ass jetpack, then you can raise an army of mutant space cats, or fight giant, sentient, time-traveling, radioactive tree-golems to reignite your murderous passion.  Constant updates and well-intentioned balance passes will never, ever address all the issues in this game, it has become an unwieldly beast that Digital Extremes can no longer control and the rabid community won't let them fix, and that's perfectly fine. Everything dies, but at least this game will end with a glorious supernova.  If you won't listen to me, then may Lotus be with you always, Tenno, but please, remember to step out and see the sun once in a while.",Recommended,2018.06.16,4.0

Warframe,✪Jellyfish,"Often described as a ""pay to win"" game. I found that not to be the case. Warframe is a third person shooter that is easy to pick up and rewards players who put time and effort into the game. The initial learning curve is set quite high, but can be made easier with help from the rather polite online community. Missions can seem repetitive at times, but the constant addition of new content and game mechanics make Warframe always feel fresh. Being still only in beta, there are a few minor bugs that stop it from being one of the top free to play games around. These issues however, hardly detract from the game itself and are only noticible because the rest of the game feels so polished. Overall, Warframe is a genuinely good game that has a lot of things going for it. I look forward to the developers Live Release and whatever additional changes accompany it.",Recommended,2014.05.23,166.6

The art style is utterly unique, the character designs are gorgeous, and--most vitally--the combat feels fast-paced, easy to grasp, and tremendously satisfying.  Note that I'm not a player who finds grinding to be tedious, so I admit this might be an obstacle to people who want to get into the game right away. Warframe is a bit of a slow burn game, but the new player experience has only improved over the years since its initial launch. I would recommend this game to everyone, especially fans of the looter-shooter genre. Bear with the grind a little while, and you'll eventually create your own way to play.  PS: At least play up to the Second Dream questline. No, no, don't ask. Just do it.",Recommended,2019.12.14,871.9
Warframe,BookishNerDan,"Want to be a space ninja? Wish Diablo was actually fun? Like doing parkour at high speed while firing off high-powered, dangerous weaponry?  Warframe has a reputation for being hard on new players, but it really isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. And while it's true the game doesn't do a good job of explaining things - did you know you can make multiple (unique) blueprints in your foundry at the SAME TIME?!?! - the game's community is fantastic and very helpful. And if you're stuck trying to figure out what to do next, there's always Google.  This isn't rocket science, it's just a Diablo (Path of Exile, Grim Dawn) style, 3rd-person, sci-fi looter-shooter with buttery smooth game play - and I can't praise just how well this game plays; it's a miracle of fun, engaging game play. The guns feel amazing, jumping and parkouring all over the map makes you feel like a super hero, and the combat is fast paced with a ton of different game modes.  Yes the game is free to play, but this is not Genshin Impact or Lost Ark or (shudder) Diablo Immortal. The game can be played totally free without having to spend a dime and there are no pay to win elements in the game. You can also play this game solo, though even when you play with a group at low levels, it's still like you're playing solo since everyone just blasts through the map anyway. So if you're stuck on a boss fight or particular mission, getting a group going is easy and painless.  Warframe is an incredibly fun game with a TON of content. And I mean it's got a TON of content; it's absurd how much you can do in this game. There are huge open world areas, there's fishing, there's Archwing missions which are like arcade-style 3D flying games, and there's a ton more too.  And the game is really good if you're an older gamer like me who just doesn't have a ton of time to game everyday. You can log in, do a few quick missions, then log out. There's not feeling like you have to get a bunch of busy work done if you don't want to do all that. The game respects your time (and your wallet).  Honestly, even though Warframe is a very famous game, I feel like it's still slept on by a lot of gamers. But this game deserves your attention. Warframe is ridiculously fun, like accidentally stay up till 4am because you're having too much fun shooting aliens and jumping around cool spaceships and space stations.  Seriously, check this game out and give it a chance, it's fricken brilliant.",Recommended,2022.08.18,372.7

Warframe,Turtle,"Warframe feels like a game about grinding and leveling up. You find resources by completing missions that you can use to craft new weapons, equipment and character warframes to level up. Enemies drop mods infrequently that you use to constantly power up your arsenal. There's absoulutely sometehing to be said about Warframe's ability to continue to be interesting and fun despite the repeetition of some missions. No doubt owed to the comfortable and varied gunplay mechanics, the complicated damage system[img1.wikia.nocookie.net], clever acrobatic techniques, and variety of end-game content. The gameplay is fast and intense, and the matchmaking is solid enough to allow seamless cooperative play with friends or strangers.  The game is free to play so I'd recommend it if you want to see how a truely fair f2p business model works.

(Don't pay attention to the number of hours shown on this account; I played quite a bit off steam, so I probably have a few hundred hours in this game.)  This game is a blast! Not only does it look gorgeous, but because the game focuses on martial arts as a core mechanic and ethos, the movement and combat are exceptionally smooth and satisfying. The different Warframes--specialized suits of war worn by the Tenno--are all distinct and beautifully crafted (with even more opportunity for customization through dyes and various cosmetics). The weapons are unique and satisfying to play with (even better when they're modded) and the different skills and abilities all lend new tactical possibilities to the missions.  Honestly, I can't recommend this game enogh!  PROS:      CONS:    If you're interested, have a look at this video to see some mid-game gear and action:   On a closing note, if you've been looking for an alternative to Destiny (whether because you don't have a console or if you don't particularly like the game), then give Warframe a look.",Recommended,2016.03.28,2.2

Warframe,NyxCrab,"Warframe is a game where you're a robot ninja and you go around with 3 other robot ninja's and prepare to curbstomp the entire enemy opposition because of all the characters unique abilities. This game can also be described as Metal Gear Rising meets Halo meets Dead Space meets Borderlands. You got the fast paced robot ninja action ala Metal Gear, the characters looking like Halo and Dead Space, the infested feel like Halo Flood and the Dead Space Necromorph, and the 4 player drop in drop out co-op and grinding is like Borderlands. Of course, the devs where smart when they designed the grinding aspect, as the map has a unique thingy that allows each and every time to be different so you don't get bored of running through the same place a million times to go fight this boss, which is where borderlands failed. The microtransactions are kinda weird though, but nothing too major unless you like to waste money buying items when it's easier and cheaper to go find the components, build it, and then rush the item. The action is very fast and flowing, where you could go from jumping in the air shooting at people to sliding into people and insta gibbing them with your melee weapon. It's all very fun, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes fast paced ninja robot action  TL;DR: THIS GAME IS GOOD GET IT YOU AS SHOLE.",Recommended,2014.09.13,4.0

But that doesn't mean i'm changing my opinion, The New War is finally out and it didn't disappoint, we got the best cinematic endgame quest to end the year, and i think it's a good note to end it on.",Recommended,2018.07.09,2.0

Experiencing new warframes, new quests, and new weapons is what gives me the most excitment.

Warframe,The Darkened Soul,"I LOVED this game on Xbox One and it's probably better on PC, though due to certain errors of my own, I can't play it on PC yet. If you like Halo and you liked Gears Of War and you minus any cursing and you love to fly around the map slicing EVERYTHING into bits, or just like your basic DAKA DAKA DAKA machine gun tactics, then this game is for you. Also there is some ""magic"" stuff for you wizard types. The story for some of the missions is perfect and the droid like guy you talk to is funny.  BUT, there is one downside, atleast for the Xbox One Version... You have to grind for a bit to get to where you want to be OR you could pay to get things. Thats the only downside.  Unlike Destiny where you have to grind to get to where you want to be at and spend hours apon hours apon hours playing the same mission grinding over and over over to the point to where you get sick of hearing the characters talk all the time, WarFrame offers at least a couple hundred missions, not all have a story line though.",Recommended,2015.09.01,685.9

There's a reason its little convention in Ontario got a Twitch viewer count of 500k, on par with some E3 presentations earlier in the year. There's a reason it's still growing and still making money.  It is, when you manage to find your footing in what is a very complicated game, a very GOOD game.

If the host is lagging then the enemies lag; If the host's connection dies then it tries to hand it off which takes more than 10 seconds usually with a full reconnect screen required. Sometimes it just kicks you out and asks if you want to reconnect to the squad.  Another thing is enemies that climb objects sometimes clip into the objects or teleport to the top of the objects.  Everything else is great about this game.,Recommended,2017.10.21,658.8

Being a space ninja ou are very agile and can pull off parkour with ease. the gunplay is satisfying and has a lot of impact with great sound assests make hearing and feeling the pop of a headshot! i cannot reccomend this game enough! but the gripes i have is that the entry level is massive with most of the weapons and frames being very daunting for new player, along with some grind.

U spend hours trying to new equipment only to find that there is even stronger ones coming out later, which of cause u will and want and spend more hours farming to get it, so if u got nothing to do anymore and enjoy sci-fi action i would recommend because i have to admit this is a good game",Recommended,2015.03.24,172.9
Warframe,Steweee,"Where has this game been? I wish i had known about this game years ago. It is a grind but its supposed to be and I've been enjoying every moment. The crafting system works well and you feel accomplished when you finally collect enough parts for a new item. I felt lost at first and still do on some things but the journey is a blast. Best part is that its free. Yes, you can pay but you never need to. Anything you can buy you can also earn in game. After my experience thus far, I will pay just to support the devs. After all the games I've purchased that weren't worth it, this one is. If you're on the fence about trying this game, just do it. Give it a week or two. You have nothing to lose and possibly a lot to gain.",Recommended,2018.01.15,236.0
Warframe,Jamzor,"Usually my type of game isn't FPS or sci-fi. I need games that are a bit slower and more measured with high fantasy and a good magic system, but for some reason Warframe just clicks for me. The Parkour is amazing and the number of Warframes (each a class of its own) with the crazy synergy between their abilities (have to check the Wiki!) is just ridiculous. And they're pretty much just all void magic anyway! It is hard to convince friends to give it a try, because the new player experience still just doesn't do the game justice in a way that ""hooks"" you at the start. But if you can get past that hurdle, it is an amazing game with a ton of content.",Recommended,2024.12.31,1.0

Numerous times the developers have purposely removed aspects of the game that are too pay to win, and the only reason that the game has survived since 2014 is because the developers actively tweak the games in ways that benefit the game, no matter if the players like them or not. Movement is fluid and smooth, and you feel like a god bullet-jumping and running through maps.

I'd argue that after the experiment with Cetus all the content islands should have been like Whispers. I understand that Railjack was also a big picture plan to connect all the content islands, and maybe that's still brewing but no one would rightly hold their breath on that.  For now, whispers is a solid step forward from all the isolated islands.  Content island tl;dr: Cetus was okay for the first set, I did enjoy hunting Terry Harry and Garry a lot. Fortuna had cool story and some interesting missions with the GTA alert system, but the finale fight was unintuitive and lacking, but I made sure I could do it and farm it solo. Demois visually was interesting, but lacking in every single way. Combat wasn't fun, the missions were meh mostly due to the lacking combat. Rep currencies were only manageable because of grandma.

Warframe,Gr8,"I've been playing this game on and off agin for the last 3 years since its release on steam, as it does get repetative, but that good repetative ya know? Digital Extreme (<-creators) has built a world that you can get really into, with the lore and different styles of enemies. Also with them pumping out constant content is what keeps drawing me back to this game. All in all i LOVE this game, but I'm always playing alone so it gets tedious at time grinding away by my lonesome. But yes of corse I very much recommend this game.",Recommended,2016.04.02,2.0

Warframe,SushiOkami,"Dear future Tenno, This is a game about working hard towards your goal of becoming a badass, armed-to-the-teeth, bonified space ninja. Well technically there is a space pirate...ninja...and a gunslinger ninja...and...a dragon.....also i'm pretty sure there's a kitty cat berserker....then theres also primed versions and I mean the game is like..really lean on the whole ninja title..You do ninja stuff though! I promise! Basically you can either be a badass ninja, or a crazy hunter killer who is extremely efficient and murdering everything that moves...wait is that a ninja? I may have just described a ninja twice.....buuuuuut I am getting ahead of myself here.  Basically you start off as a scrub like any other game. You work hard and unlock nodes to planets and assassinate bosses and such. It may sound pretty flat when I say it like this. But ooooh boy. There's just something special when you sprint towards an enemy...spin around and cleave their entire body in half...then pull out a bow and shoot a single arrow that pins 3 other enemies to a wall. Or using one of your warframe's powers to decimate an entire squad of enemies.  Just know this game is pretty grind-y. You're going to be running certain missions repeatedely for a RNG item to drop that allows you to build something awesome. Like another warframe...or a weapon...or a pet...or..whatever. There is end tier content like raids and high leveled void missions and such. The only main problem this game has is the grind factor. But hey, if you enjoy being a friggen space ninja, and you enjoy murdering things. Then go ahead and give this game a try!  Also there is a pay-to-win kinda thing in-game. But it should be more or less called the pay to not wait as long to craft everything in the game...thing. Don't let that bother you though, everything in the game is unlockable for free. Again, this game is grindy and requires patience...y'know..like...like a ninja...Just give it a try! -Sincerely, Other Tenno Person!",Recommended,2015.07.19,2.0

Warframe,Eramidas,"There are a lot of free to play games out there that either feel unpolished or pay to win. If you like shooters or you like RPG's this is a great game to try out. It's constantly updated with new content so there's always something to do, you can create or join a clan and build or help a clan build your own Dojo, which is awesome. There's a currency you can buy with real money but it can also be earned in game by trading with other players, giving them some extra parts you don't need. When you craft things you can rush it with platinum which almost turned me away at first because I thought it would be as annoying as those mobile apps with rush but I got used to it short after and started to barely even notice since I passed the time doing fun missions.

Warframe is a thrid person shooter, with emphasis on grinding, and on teamwork. If you seek to play this (amazing) game, I'd recommend a team of four (you and three of your ninja'est friends) with some form of vocal interaction such as ""Teamspeak"" or ""Discord"" as Voice settings aren't really prevalent, or high value. If you enjoy the ""grind"" like in Monster Hunter, or Phantasy Star, you'll love Warframe, and remember: ""Space Ninja's play free""",Recommended,2014.08.30,5.0

Warframe,Snixpix,"This game. If I remember correctly, I found Warframe right before Easter 2013. Everybody I knew was getting bored of ME3 multi or still playing Skyrim. I found Warframe one night tooling around on steam looking for something to replace them, and what a replacement I found. Warframe gave me the PvE and the grindy-collection I was looking for. It's missions can be so fast paced that you will loose track of time and, if you are like me, make other games seem like they are lacking. Digital Extremes updates and patches this game so often that it is almost a completely different gameplay since I started playing way back in April. I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's perfect, everything has cons. Every once in a while hotfixes or patches will break something in the game and we the players have to report it to DE for them to fix it, usually they are pretty good at clearing these things out, but hey, it's technically a beta.  To keep blabbering on about what a good game it is would be repititious, so I'll leave you with this: if you like PvE, 4-person coop, extreme character agility, ability powers, and all with somewhat grindy crafting system that you can make a multitude of unique weapons with interchangeable mods; you will like this game.",Recommended,2013.12.05,2.0

The TL;DR of the game: kill things, farm stuff, grow in power.  The gameplay loop is nice, you always have a primary, a secondary and a melee weapon on you. Run and gun, hack and slash. Jumping around feels nice after you get used to it.  The only major downside IMO is power creep. Once you get too powerful, there is no challenge. Without challenge there is no fun. And a personal nitpick - not enough blood.",Recommended,2013.12.06,19.0
